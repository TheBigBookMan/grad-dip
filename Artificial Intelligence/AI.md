## Introduction
- **Define AI**- making machines seem like they are acting like humans
- **History AI**- past half century
	- 1956 coined AI, see if it could develop like a child with problem solving etc
- **Driving development**-
	- 90% of worlds data generated in past 2 years
	- computers can now make sense of it
- **Different areas**- 
	- Robots are the shell of the AI going on under the hood
	- ML machines become better overtime from learning from experience
- **Recent successes**
	- facial recognition
	- text recognition
	- self-driving vehicles
- **AI Branches**-
	- **Game Playing**- define strateigies to play specific games like chess, based on previously made experiences from games
	- **Automated Resoning**- conduct logic reasoning (propositiona llogic, first order login, high order logic, abductive logic) by using a computer
		- problems that require logical steps to get to the solution
		- we put the understanding of the problem in ourselves to the machine
	- **Knowledge Representation**- research on representing human knowledge in symbols to facilitate automated reasoning and storing in computers
		- formatting the data 
	- **Natural Language Processing**- analyse human language for computers to use
		- understanding, translation, analysis and summarisation of text
	- **Robotics and Planning**- robot is machine that imitates human or human activity
		- design and construction of robot (sensors, planing, decision making and mechanical moving)
	- **Machine Learning**- research and development of computer systems that are able to learn and adapt without instructions by using algorithms and statistical models to anaylyse and draw inferences from patterns in data
		- supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning and reinforacement learning
	- **Semantic web and Ontology**- research on web information representation, exraction and reasoning, which enables information exchange between apps, machines and platforms
## Logic
- using logic to represent knowledge
- **Formal language and system**
	- **Formal language**- contains
		- set of symbols (alphabet of the language)
		- set of formation rules determining which sequences of symbols from its alphabet are well formaed formulas
	- **Formal system**- 
		- formal language with a deductive apparatus is a formal system
		- a deductive appratus consists of the axioms and rules of inference that can be used to derive theoroms
- **Proppositional logic**- can be used for problem solving, planning and decision making, as well as reasoning, it helps representing knowledge in mathematical and logical form- can be either true or false
	- **Propositional Language**- 
		- is a formal language
		- alphabet of propositional language includes
			- propositional symbols (p, q, ...)
			- connectives (-(**negation** (opposite of whatever it is)), V(**disjunction** (logical OR between propositions)), ^(**conjuction** (logical AND between propositions)), <- (**implication** (proposition implies another (if one proposition is true then another must also be true))))
			- punctuation (( ))
	- **Well formed formula (wff)**- 
		- a proposition
		- if A and B are forumlas, then (-A), (A ^ B), (A V B), (A <- B) are forumlas
- **Axioms**- statemeents assumed to be true without proof
	- (A <- B) <- A
	- ((C <- A) <- (B <- A)) <- ((C <- B) <- A)
	- (A <- B) <- (-B <- -A)
- **Inference Rule**- rule of inference is modus ponens rule: A and B <- A infer B. derive new propositions from existing ones
- **First Order Logic**- extention of propositional logic, propositional = true/false, first order= one + variables
	- **Alphabet** of first order
		- **Variables** - (X, Y, Z...)
		- **Constants**- (a, b, c, ...)
		- **Function**- (f, g, ...)
		- **Predicate**- (p, q, ...)
		- **Connectives**- (- (**negation**), V (**disjunction**), ^ (**conjunction**), <- (**implicaton**))
		- **Quantifiers**- (A(Upside down) (**universal quantifier**), E (backwards) (**existing quantifier**))
		- **Punctuation** ( (  ) )
	- **Term**- 
		- a constant
		- a variable
		- f(X1, X2, ...., Xn) where f is an n-ary function symbol and X1, X2, Xn are terms
	- **Atom**- if p is a pedicate and X1, X1, ... Xn are terms, then p(X1, X2, ..., Xn) is an atom
	- **Literal**- literal is an atom or the negation of an atom, *A* positive literal is an atom, *a* negative literal is the negation
		- example- if *p* is predicate, *a*, *b*, *X* are terms: then
			- p(a + b, X, Xa) is an atom
			- p(a + b, X, Xa) is also called a positive literal and -p(a + b, X, Xa) is negative literal
	- **Formation rules of first order language**- well formed formaula (wff) is:
		- an atom
		- if *A* is a formula, then (A(upside down)X)A and (E(backwards)X)A are formulas
		- if A and B are forumlas, then (-A), (A^B), (AVB), (A<-B) are forumlas
		- Example- *p* is predicate, *a*, *b*, *c*, *X* are terms: then all these are formulas
			- p(a, b, X)
			- -p(a, c, X)
			- p(a, b, X) ^ --p(a, c, X)
			- A(upside down)X((p (a, b, X) V -p(a, c, X)) <- (p (a, b, X) ^ -p (a, c, X)))
			- These are not forumlas:
			- A(upsidedown)X (p(a, b, X) p(a, c, X))
			- p(a, b, X) ^
