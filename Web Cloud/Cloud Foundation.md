- **3 Ways AWS Manages Services**-
	- **Management Console**-
		- GUI for most of the features
	- **CLI**-
		- launched from command script 
	- **SDK**-

				- EC2
				- flexibilty for server management
				- choose the OS and the resource capabilities
			- serverless
				- lambda
				- run code without provisioning or managing servers
				- pay only for compute time that is consumed
				- dont have to pay for servers 24/7 even when not used
			- container-based 
				- ECS, EKS, Fargate, ECR
				- run multiple workloads on singular OS
				- spin up cointainer more quickly than VM 
				- offers more responsiveness
			- platform as service PaaS
				- elastic Beanstalk
				- facilitates quick deployment of apps by providing all app services you need
				- aws manages OS, app server and other infra components

## Simple Storage Service (S3)
- designed for 11 9s of durability
- can generate event notifications
- used for
	- content storage and dsitrubtion
	- backup and restore
	- archiving
	- data lakes
	- big data analytics
	- disaster recovery
	- static website hosting
- stopre static content like iamges, videos, music etc and distribute through Cloudfront edge locations or S3 directly
- back up data use storage life cycles policies to archive rarely accessed data in Glacier
- create a data lake which is a centralisecd repository that allows you to store all structured and usntructured data at any scale
	- can extract valuable insights using queries, analytics and ML
- protect critical data, apps, IT systems stuynnuing in cloud or on prem
- Cross-region replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across buckets in different AWS regions
- **Components**-
	- **Bucket**-
		- container for objects stored in S3
		- organise S3 namespace at highest level and identify the account responsible for storage and data transfer chages
		- play arole in access control and server as unit of aggregation for usage reporting
	- **Object**-
		- fundamental entity stored in S3
		- object can be anyu file like text, video, phgoto or bionary
		- objects consist of object data and emtadata
		- metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the object
		- **Two kinds of Metadata**-
			- **System-defined Metadata**-
				- set of system metadata for each object stored in bucket
				- S3 processes this system metadata as needed
				- information such as object creation date, size and cersion
			- **USer-defined Metadata**-
				- can assign metadata during or after it has been uploaded
				- stored with the object
				- S3 does not process user-defined metadata
				- must being with x-amz-meta prefix
		- When PUT object you can not do partial updates to an object, always writes the entire object
		- When GET, you need read access to the buecket
	- **Object Key**-
		- uniquely identifies the object in a bucket
		- each object in a bueckt has exactly one key
		- ![[Pasted image 20250830095743.png]]
	- each bucket is regional
	- you can choose the region where S3 stores the buckets
	- objects stored in a region never leave unless you transfer them to another region
	- region code indicates the region its stored in- us-west-2a
	- to query specific objects in a bucket you query by file path
		- scores/list-of-scores/english
		- will return english scores that are under that file directory
	- **Versioning**-
		- protect your data
		- default disabled
		- enable versioning is a weay to keep variants of an opbject in the same bucket
		- two objects in a bucket can have the same key but different version IDs
		- preserve, retrieve and restore each vbersion of every object stored in your S3 bucket
		- can recover from unintended user actions and pp failures with versioning
		- DELETE you can delete all versions of object with ObjectKey but can delete specific version with VersionId
