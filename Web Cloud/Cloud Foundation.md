- **Reasons why CLoud so popular**-
	- **Trade capital expense for variable expense**
		- ability to have flexible pricing
		- pay as tyou go
		- requirements get met in minutes as scaling can be automatixc
	- **Benefit from massive scales of economy**-
			- because so manyu customers in AWS they can have lower prices for you
	- **Stop guessing capacity**-
		- flexible usage capacity qwhich fgoes up and down byu requirements needed
	- **Increase speed and agility**-
		- time top get resources can be quick
		- time to take down also quick
	- **Stop spending money on running and mainting data centres**-
		- aws pay for all the management of data centres
	- **Go global in minutes**-
		- data centeres globally so can host resources worldwide
- **Cloud Computing Deployment Models**-
	- **CLoud**
		- fully developed in the cloud
	- **Hybrid**-
		- mix of cloud and on prem
	- **On-premises**-
		- managed in house IT infrastructure

- **3 Ways AWS Manages Services**-
	- **Management Console**-
		- GUI for most of the features
	- **CLI**-
		- launched from command script 
	- **SDK**-
		- add the services into your code

- **FOundation Services**-
	- **Storage**-
		- **S3**-
			- object storage for scalability, data availability, security and eprformance
			- store and protect data fgor web sites, mobile apps, backup and restore, archive, enterprise apps, IoT and big data
		- **EBS (eslatic block storage)**-
			- block storage designed with EC2 for both throughput and transaction-intensive workloads
			- used for various workloads such as relational and non-relational databases, apps, containerised apps, biog data, file systems
		- **EFS (elastic file system)**-
			- scalable, fully managed elastic network file sytstem for use with cloud services and on premises resourc es
			- built to scale on demaind, growing and shrinking automaticllay as you add and remove files
			- thousands of EC2 instances can access EFS simultaneously
		- **S3 Glacier**-
			- cold storage for low cost
			- takes several hours top retrieve
			- designed to deliver to 11 nines of durability
	- **Compute**-
		- **4 Categories**-
			- VMs that provide IaaC
				- EC2
				- flexibilty for server management
				- choose the OS and the resource capabilities
			- serverless
				- lambda
				- run code without provisioning or managing servers
				- pay only for compute time that is consumed
				- dont have to pay for servers 24/7 even when not used
			- container-based 
				- ECS, EKS, Fargate, ECR
				- run multiple workloads on singular OS
				- spin up cointainer more quickly than VM 
				- offers more responsiveness
			- platform as service PaaS
				- elastic Beanstalk
				- facilitates quick deployment of apps by providing all app services you need
				- aws manages OS, app server and other infra components

	- **Database**
		- **Relational Database Service (RDS)**-
			- relational database in the cloud
			- resizable capacity while automating time-consum,ing administration like hardware provisioning, DB setuip, patching anbd backuops
		- **Aurora**-
			- MySQL/PostgreSQL
			- high availability and resilient design over RDS
		  - **Redshift**-
			  - data warehouse
			  - automatically adds the nodes to yourt cluster and redistributes data for maximum performance
			  - columnar storage and massively parallel processing architecture
			  - parallelise and distribute data and queries across multiple nodes
			  - automatically monitors your cluster and backs up your data so can easily restore if needed
			  - encryption is built in
		  - **DynamoDB**-
			  - key-valyue document DB
			  - delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale
			  - built in security, backup and rest0ore, in-memory caching
			  - NoSQL DB service
			  - redundantly stores data across multiple facilities in native US region as part of fault tolerant
			  - can creat table and items, add items to table
			  - system automaticallyt partitions your data and has table storage
			  - no practical limit on number opf items you can store on a table
