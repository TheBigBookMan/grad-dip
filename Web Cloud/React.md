- **Features**-
	- **Virtual DOM**-
		- feature that makes app development faster and more flexible
		- it allows replicating a webpage within reacts virtual memoery
		- it represents the original DOM so it can see changes or updates made to the app and updates only the modified components, rather than rendering the entire UI again
		- results in reduced time and cost for development
		- for every DOM object, there is a virtual DOM object
		- the virtual DOM just doesnt have the power to change whats on the screen and this is what makes 
		- every virtual DOM object gets updated when rendering a JSX element- sounds inefficient but it isnt because virtual DOM is updated very quickly
		- once virtual DOM updated, it takes a snapshot for comparison and then determines what has changed by comparing the old with the new to update only what has changed
		- 'diffing' is the comparison of changes
		- 
	- **JSX**-
		- markup syntax describes the appearance of apps interface
		- makes syntax like HTML and combines javascript into
		- allows for a lot more flexibility with development
	- **React Native**-
		- uses native rather than web components for andoid and iOS
		- transforms react code to render compatible with phones native features
	- **One-way Data Binding**-
		- uses unidirectional flow of data, forcing developers to use callback feature to edit components and prevent them from direct editing
		- controlling of data flow from a single point is achieved with a JS app architectuce called Flux
		- affords devs better control over the app and makes more flexible and effective
	- **Declarative UI**-
		- react code readable and makes it easier to fix bugs
	- **Component-based Architecture**-
		- user interface of app based on react comprises of several components each with particular logic
		- devs can relay the data across the app without DOM being impacted
		- components play large role in deciding apps visuals and itneractions
