## Containers
- **Containers**-
	- **Before containers**-
		- deploying and managing apps took a lot of work
		- each app required distinct environment with specific prerequisites for libraries, runtime and system resources
		- administering these vaired envionrments was similar to managing diverse shipping containers
	- **With Containers**-
		- softwar containers are uniform, modular and portable
		- simplifying deployment and scaling
		- apps enclosed in containers can be moved effortleslly between environments; developer laptops, onprem data centres or cloud
		- dont have to worry about compatability issues
		- bundle up the code and all its dependencies into a container
		- increases productivity, efficiency and cost-effectiveness
		- serverless servies like Fargate no longer manage underlying infra which makes even more ease of transport of containers
- **AWS Container Services**-
	- **Elastic Container Service (ECS)**-
		- high performance container orchestration supporting docker containers'
		- use the service to run and scale containerised apps on aws
		- can schedule placement of containers across a managed cluster of EC2 instances
		- provides its own schedulers but can integrate with third-party schedulers to meet busines or app specific requirements
		- is highlight integrated with other AWS services
	- **Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**-
		- cloud-based docker image registry that makes storing, manaing and deploying docker container images easy
		- integrates with ECS and docker CLI
		- simplifying development and production workflows
		- push your container images to ECR by using docker CLI and ECS can pull directly for prod deployments
		- reduces the need to operate container repos or be concerned about scaling the infra
		- hots images in highly available and scalabe architecture
		- ECR transfers your images over HTTPS and automatically encrypts at rest
		- can configure policies to manage permissions for each repo and restrit access to IAM users, roles or other AWS accounts
	- **Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**-
		- container management platform used to deploy and manage containerised apps at scale
		- manages clusters of EC2 instances and runs containers on those instances with deployment, maintenance and scaling processes
		- can run any containerised app using the same toolset on-pre and in cloud
		- can use aws services to run kubernetes in the cloud
		- scalable and highly available VM infra, community created service integrations and EKS
		- is a managed service that runs kubernetes management infra across multiple availability zones to reduce single point of failure
		- ![[Pasted image 20250903132950.png]]
		- any apps that run on standard kubernetes environment fully compatbile on EKS
		- EKS automatically sets up secure and encrypted channes to worker nodes
		- when selecting EKS you provision an EKS cluster and deploy EC2 or fargate worker nodes
	- **ECS-ECR Solution Architecture**-
		- first step is retrieve images from a registry (ECR or docker)
		- customise the containerimages with the necessary code and resources and create config files to group them
		- defined your containers as short running tasks or long running services in ECS
		- choose between EC2 or Fargate to bring services online
		- use a combination of both launch types for app
		- ECS manages your containers by scaling app and ensuring availability
		- ![[Pasted image 20250903133410.png]]
	- **Fargate or EC2**-
		- **Fargate**-
			- serverless so AWS manages the infra to support the containers
			- manages the placement of your tasks on isntances and ensures that each task has the appropriate amount of CPU and memory
			- you can focus on the app instead of worrying about infra
			- choose when
				- services subject to wide swings in demand
				- large workloads that are optimised for low overhead
				- small test environments
				- batch workloads that run on a schedule
			- ![[Pasted image 20250903133753.png]]
		- **EC2**-
			- when you want more control over the infra that supports your tasks
			- you create and manage the EC2 clusters of E2 instances to support containers
			- also define the placement of containers across the cluster based on resource needs, isolation, policites and availability requirements
			- nmore granular control over your environment without operating your own cluster and config management systems or worrying about scaling management infra
			- choose when
				- more predictable resource requirements or option of using reserved instances to reduce costs
				- large workloads that are optimised for price
				- compliance with organisational security requirements
				- excess EC2 capacity
		- Choose EC2 when you have more predictable resource requirements
		- fargate to launch other services subject to wide swings in demand

## Elastic Block Storage (EBS)
- persistant storage for EC2 instances
- volumes are network-attached and persist independently from the life of an instance
- highly available, reliable volumes that can be leveraged as an EC2 instances boot partition or attached to a running EC2 as standard block device
- **Boot Partition**-
	- EC2 instances can be stopped abnd restarted, enabling you to pay only for the storage resources used while maintaining your instances state
- volume offer greatly improved durability over EC2 instance stores because EBS volumes are automatically replicated on the backend (in a single AZ)
- used as it can persist data between EC2 instances when one goes down and another goes up
- has the ability to create point-in-time consistent snapshots of your volumes that are stored in S3 and automatically replicated across multiple AZ
- snapshots used as starting point for new EBS volumwes and can protect your data long-term durability
- can also share these snapshots with other aws devs
- **Volume Features**-
	- **Persistent Storage**-
		- volume lifetime is independent of any partiular EC2 instance
	- **General Purpose**-
		- volumes are raw, unformatted block devices that can be used from any OS
	- **High PErformance**-
		- are equal to or better than local EC2 drives
	- **High Reliability**-
		- have built-in redundancy within an AZ
	- **Designed for Resliency**-
		- the annual failure rate is between 0.1 to 1%
	- **Variable Size**-
		- volume sizes range from 1GB to 16 TB
	- **Easy to Use**-
		- can easily be created, attached, backedup, restored and deleted

## Relational Database Service (RDS)
- easy to setup, operate and scale a relational database in cloud
- provides cost-efficient and resizeable capacity while managing time-consuming database admin tasks
- can choose between Aurora, Oracle, Microsoft SQL, PostgreSQL, Mysql, mariaDB

## Infrastructure
- **Elastic Load Balancing**-
	- automatically distribute incoming app traffic across multiple EC2 instances
	- enables achieve fault tolerance in your apps
	- provides required amount of load balancing capacity needed to route app traffic
- **Auto-Scaling**-
	- maintain app availability and allows you to scale your EC2 capacity automatically according conditions you define
	- use to ensure you are running desired number of EC2 instances during demand spikes to maintain performance and decrease capacity during lulls to reduce costs
	- well suited to apps that have stable demand patterns or that experience hourly, daily, weekly variability in usage

## CI/CD
- process of deploying artificats to various environments, including testing, staging and production
- can either be done entirely automatically or with approval stages at crucial points
- steps ensure all necessary approvals, such as release management are obtained before deployment
- developers can rely on deployment-ready build artifacts that has undergone a standardised testing process
  **Continous Integration and Continuous Delivery**-
	- software dev practice that aims to automate and streamline the process for building, testing and deploying software apps
	- involves regularly integrating code changes from multiple devs into shared repo
	- each integration triggers an automated build process that compiles the code, runs automated tests and generates reports
	- ensures that code changes are integrated smoothly and helps identify issues early in development cycle
	- continous deployment extends integration by automating the deployment process
	- involves automatically packaging the application, deploying it to various environments and running additional tests in each environment
	- allows for rapid and frequent releases of new features or bug fixes
	- continuous delivery all about reducing risk and delivering value faster by producing reliable software in short iterations
	- ![[Pasted image 20250903142025.png]]
	- when committing code to repo the repo server automatically notifies the CI server
	- CI server running on a different machine will automatically do the build process
		- compile the code
		- run unit tests
		- run integration test
		- package the code
	- CI systems automatically deploy the code onto the server
- **Development Operations (DevOps)**-
	- applications run together with other services in specific systems
	- the apps in the cloud are the apps + infrastructure
