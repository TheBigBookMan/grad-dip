- **Cloud computing advantages**-
	- **Cost Savings**- save businesses money on hardware, software and IT staff
	- **Scalability**- scaled up or down as needed, saves businesses money during periods on low demand
	- **Agility**- help businesses be more agile and responsive to changing market conditions
	- **Security**0- variety of security features that can help busionsess preotect their data

## Version Control
- **Subversion SVN**- version control but centralised
	- the main root is on a central server
	- each developer only has one branch on their local
	- has to be up to date with the central server
	- cannot have nested branch
	- rely on the central one storage server
	- one place for thge version history
- **Git**-
	- distrubuted source control
	- develoeprs can have full version on their device
	- many branches

## Virtualisation
- **Advantages VMs in Cloud**-
	- **Scalability**-
		- scale computing resources up and down based on demand
		- organistions can easily adjust number of VM instances and resources allocated
		- ensuring optimatl performance and cost-efficiency
	- **Cost Savings**-
		- elimante the need for upfront hardware investments and associated maintenance costs
		- organisations leverage pay-as-you-go model
	- **Rapid Provisioning**-
		- provisioned quickly- in minutes
		- scale infra rapidly and respond to business needs faster and reduces time required for deploying new apps or services
	- **High Availability and Redundancy**-
		- offer robust infra and redundancy measures to ensure high availability of VM instances
		- data centres located different regions providing failover options and minimising risk of downtime
	- **Flexibility and Customisation**-
		- various config options, allowing organisations to choose their desired operating system, software stack an resource allocation
		- flexibilty enables custom environments for each apps requirements
- **Disadvantages of Implementing VMs in Cloud**-
	- **Dependency on Internet Connectivety**-
		- require stable internet connection to access and manage them
		- organisations may face challenges and utilising their VM instances in unreliable or limited connectivity cases
	- **Potential Vendor lock-in**-
		- mving VMs between cloud providers can be complex and time consuming
		- organisations may face challenges if they want to migrate their VMs from one provider to another, as compatability and migration tools vary
		- result in vendor lock in and limit flexibility i nchoosing diferent providers
	- **Performance Variability**-
		- performance can be influenced by factors such as network latency, shared resources and virtualisation overhead
		- sometimes organisations experience performance fluctuations, particularly sharing physical resources with other cloud users
	- **Data Security and Compliance**-
		- organisations must carefully consider data security and compliance when implementing VMs in the cloud
		- must ensure appropriate security measures, access controls and data encryption to protect sensitive information
		- compliance with industry regulations and data residency requirements may also need to be addressed
	- **Cost Management**-
		- must carefully manage their resources usage to avoid unexpected costs
		- organisations may face higher than anticipated cloud bills if resources are not adequately monitorired or optimised
- **Dependency Matrix from Hell**-
	- so many dependencies for applications
	- different versions can happen acros environments and cause incompatibility
	- different versions of libraries causes conflicts and deployment issues
- **How containers overcome dependency matrix from hell**-
	- **Encapsulate Environments**-
		- encapsulate application and its dependencies, creating isolated runtime environments
		- each container includes necessary runtime components, libraries and dependencies to run application without affecting host system or other containers
		- isolation elimnates conflicts between different apps and their dependncies
	- **Reproducible Builds**-
		- define the apps runtime environment in a reproducible manner
		- container image includes a snapshot of the app, its dependices and underlying system components
		- ensuring apps run consistently across different enviroinoments, regardless of underlying host system config or dependencies
	- **Portability**-
		- designed to be portable across different environments, including development machines, testing environments and prod servers
		- because container includes all necessary dependencies, it can quickly move from one environment to another without worrying about compatability or versioning issues
		- portability simplifies the deployment process and ensures consistent behaviour across different environments
	- **Dependency Management**-
		- container orchestration such as kubernetes to manage and deploy large scale containerised apps
		- platforms provide features like service discovery, load balancing and audomtate scaling
		- simplify dependency management by allowing deployment and coordidation of multiple container, manaing their interconnections and ensuring the availability of required dependencies
	- **Versioning and Rollbacks**-
		- containers enable versioning and rollbacks at container level
		- each container image can be tagged with specific version, allowing easy tracking and management of different versions of an app
		- in case issues or failures, rollbacks can be performaed by reverting to previous container image, ensuring rapid recovery without affecting other containers or host system
	- **Infrastructure Agnosticism**-
		- designed to be infra agnostic
		- abstract away the underlying infra and run consistently across different host systems, whether a dev machine, local server or cloud based environment
		- flexibility allows organisations to leverage different infra proiders or switch between environments without significantly modifying application or its dependencies
