- **Cloud computing advantages**-
	- **Cost Savings**- save businesses money on hardware, software and IT staff
	- **Scalability**- scaled up or down as needed, saves businesses money during periods on low demand
	- **Agility**- help businesses be more agile and responsive to changing market conditions
	- **Security**0- variety of security features that can help busionsess preotect their data

## Version Control
- **Subversion SVN**- version control but centralised
	- the main root is on a central server
	- each developer only has one branch on their local
	- has to be up to date with the central server
	- cannot have nested branch
	- rely on the central one storage server
	- one place for thge version history
- **Git**-
	- distrubuted source control
	- develoeprs can have full version on their device
	- many branches

## Virtualisation
- **Advantages VMs in Cloud**-
	- **Scalability**-
		- scale computing resources up and down based on demand
		- organistions can easily adjust number of VM instances and resources allocated
		- ensuring optimatl performance and cost-efficiency
	- **Cost Savings**-
		- elimante the need for upfront hardware investments and associated maintenance costs
		- organisations leverage pay-as-you-go model
	- **Rapid Provisioning**-
		- provisioned quickly- in minutes
		- scale infra rapidly and respond to business needs faster and reduces time required for deploying new apps or services
	- **High Availability and Redundancy**-
		- offer robust infra and redundancy measures to ensure high availability of VM instances
		- data centres located different regions providing failover options and minimising risk of downtime
	- **Flexibility and Customisation**-
		- various config options, allowing organisations to choose their desired operating system, software stack an resource allocation
		- flexibilty enables custom environments for each apps requirements
- **Disadvantages of Implementing VMs in Cloud**-
	- **Dependency on Internet Connectivety**-
		- require stable internet connection to access and manage them
		- organisations may face challenges and utilising their VM instances in unreliable or limited connectivity cases
	- **Potential Vendor lock-in**-
		- mving VMs between cloud providers can be complex and time consuming
		- organisations may face challenges if they want to migrate their VMs from one provider to another, as compatability and migration tools vary
		- result in vendor lock in and limit flexibility i nchoosing diferent providers
	- **Performance Variability**-
		- performance can be influenced by factors such as network latency, shared resources and virtualisation overhead
		- sometimes organisations experience performance fluctuations, particularly sharing physical resources with other cloud users
	- **Data Security and Compliance**-
		- organisations must carefully consider data security and compliance when implementing VMs in the cloud
		- must ensure appropriate security measures, access controls and data encryption to protect sensitive information
		- compliance with industry regulations and data residency requirements may also need to be addressed
	- **Cost Management**-
		- must carefully manage their resources usage to avoid unexpected costs
		- organisations may face higher than anticipated cloud bills if resources are not adequately monitorired or optimised
- **Dependency Matrix from Hell**-
	- so many dependencies for applications
	- different versions can happen acros environments and cause incompatibility
	- different versions of libraries causes conflicts and deployment issues
