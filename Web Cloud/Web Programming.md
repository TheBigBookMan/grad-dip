- **Three Tier Architecture**-
	- **Presentation Tier**-
		- responsible for displaying data to user and receving user input
		- tpyical;l;y includes web browser, web server and UI
		- HTML, CSS, JS
	- **Application Tier**-
		- processes data and performs business logic
		- typicallyt includes an application server, a database and programmiong language
	- **Data Tier**-
		- stores data and provides access to data for app tier
		- typically includes database server and data access layer
	- Three tiers connected by network and communicate with each other user well-defined interfaces
	- allows each tier to be developed and maintained independetly

- **Six-Tier Architecture**-
	- extends three tier but adds additional latyers
	- ehance scalability, flexibility and maintainability
	- each tier serves a specific purpoise and has own responsibilities
	- ![[Pasted image 20250803092548.png]]
- **HTML**-
- **DOM**-
	- structured elements of an html document in form of tree
	- can specify which element of html doc we want to modify or apply particular style to

- **Javascript**- 
	- reasons why JS is essential web dev
		- **Client Side Interactivity**-
			- executed on client side meaning runs directly on browser
			- enables dtynamic interactions with webpages allowing for real-time updates, form validation, , animations and user interface enhancements
			- enables more engaging and interactive user experience
		- **DOM Manipulation**-
			- powerful capabilities to access and manipulate a webpage DOM
			- develoeprs dynamically modify the structure, content and styling of HTML elements on fly
			- respond to user actions and update page accordingly
		- **Event Handling**-
			- enables event-driven programming allowing develoeprs to define actions or behaviours responding to user events such as clicks, mouse movements, keyboard inputs etc
			- event handling enables creation of interactive features like drop-down menus, image sliders, form validation and interactive maps
		- **Asynchronous Operations**-
			- async programming through callbacks, promises and asyn/awaits
			- allows for non-blocking operations like making HTTP requests to servers, fetching data from APIs or performing time-consuming tasks without freezing user interface
			- asyn operations enhance responsiveness and performance of web apps
		- **Cross Browser Capabilitiy**-
			- supported by all major web brwosers making it universal
			- provides consistent way to add functionality to webpages regartdless of browser being userd by end user
		- **Frameworks and Libraries**-
			- vast eceosystem of frameworks and librarties
			- simplify web dev
			- provide tools, reuseable components and structured patterns for building complex web apps more efficiently
		- **Server-side Development**-
			- node as backend for server side javascript
			- developers can write front and back ends ion javascript
			- easier communication and code sharing between
	- **Document Object**-
		- a way for javaqscript to access the HTML source code
		- manipulate the DOM
