- **Network Foundation**-
	- data networks which were initially used to carry iunformation from one company to another are now being utilised to improve quality of life worldwide
	- most businesses utilise software packages that provide rmote workgroups
	- people who work together but not in the exact regional point to collaborate on documents and databases in real time
- **Network Architecture**-
	- network architects must design the internet to suit the demands of the web and its users, like archicests for buildings
	- internet has considerably exceeded its initial size and usage assumptions
	- fault tolerance, scalability, quality of service and security are all built into internets design
	- **Fault Tolerance**-
		- reduces the effect of hardware or software failures and allows for speedy redovery
		- commonly accomplished through redundancy which entails having duplicate connections or equipment between the source and destination
		- ![[Pasted image 20250919132609.png]]
	- **Scalability**-
		- refers to capcity to add more users, apps, tools and other networks fast without compromising the performance of the service being supplied to current users
		- accomplished by developing the systems underlying physical infrastructure and logical design in a hierarchical layered design
		- ![[Pasted image 20250919132748.png]]
	- **Quality of Service**-
		- refers to the mechanism that manages congested network
		- congestion occurs when bandwidth demand exceeds the network capaibility
		- quality of service is achived by using a priority (class) system
		- ![[Pasted image 20250919132849.png]]
	- **Security**-
		- essential for many network users such as banks and other organisations
		- security must address 2 areas
			- network infrastructure security
				- protecting network devices from outside contact
			- content security
				- protecting the network content in various ways such as availability, confidentiality and integrity
		- network outages, misdirection and loss of personal or corporate finances; firm intellectual property stolen or utilised by a rival; and customer contract data made public resulting in a loss of market trust might all result from network breach
		- ![[Pasted image 20250919133150.png]]
	- **Fault Tolerance Network Architecture**
		- **Network Switching Types**-
			- understanding how this resilience was achieved begins with a comparison of 2 fundamental types of network switching
				- **Circuit-Switched, Connection-Oriented Networks**-
					- phone operators and early dial-up systems established a temporary circuit, a physical link on which the phone signal would flow from sender to receiver to connect telephone calls
					- system was connection-oriented becasue any physical disconnects or service difficulties would result in the call between users being dropped
					- would necessitate starting a new call and setting up a new system
				- **Packet-Switched, Connectionless Networks**-
					- converting to this solved the fault-tolerance problem
					- single message is split into little data blocks known as packets over a packet-switched network, which address information for the sender and recipient
					- the packets are routed across numerous networks and resembled at their final spot
					- because the call does not require an active connection to go through, packet-switched technology is connectionnless
					- because numerous users may utilise network circuits simultaneously, this is more efficient than circuit-switched networks
		- **Scalable Network Architecture**-
			- reliable connectivity may expand without requiring significant changes to its core
			- scalable design is seen from the internet
			- internet developed exponentially over last decade but the basic design has remained unaltered- comprises of several private and public networks that are linked together through systems
			- central domain servers that track internet addresses are housed by significant tier-1 ISPs
			- system bottom later, the data is copied and hsared
			- most traffic is processed away from the upper-tier servers thanks to its hierarchical, multitirered design
			- because of how processing work is distributed, changes made at the lower tiers, such as adding a new ISP have no impact on the top levels
		- **Providing Quality of Service (QoS)**-
			- procedures that control congested network traffic are known as QoS
			- when demand for network resources exceeds the available capacity, congestion occurs
			- some network resource limits cannot be overcome
			- technology limits, price and local availability of high-bandwidth services are all constraints
			- data-carrying capability of a network is measured by its bandwidth
			- when several communications are attempted across the network simultaneously, network capacity may be in short supply
			- apaprent solution to this problem is the enhance the availble range
			- **Priority Decisions for an Organisation**-
				- **Time-sensitive Communication**- 
					- prioritise services such as telephony and video delivery
				- **Non-Time-Sensitive Communication**-
					- reduce the priority of retrieving webpages or sending emails
				- **High Importance to an Organisation**-
					- prioritise data on production control or commercial transactions
				- **Undesireable Communication**-
					- reduce the importance of undesired activities (e.g. peer-to-peer file sharing or live entertainment) or prohibit them entirely
		- **Providing Network Security**-
			- online service has always been a productive environment for business, with year-on-year increases in B2B transactions and ecommerce
			- scammers and vandals are drawn to the same milieu that draws genuine businesses
			- integrity of firm assets might be jeopardised, resulting in significant economic and financial consequences
			- as a result, web providers and users are concerned about network security and online safety is essential for any network management strategy
			- system safety breach can lead to several serious repercussions
				- network interruption that results in loss of communication and commercial transactions
				- the loss of personal or commercial cash
				- intellectual property theft (including proposals for projects, patents and strategic plans)
				- exposure of confidential customer data- could cause a customer to lose confidence in the company and hasten to a more reliable vendor
				- to provide security a network manager must address
					- network infrastructure security
					- content security

## Network as Platform
- **Elements of the Network**-
	- systems are software-based communication programs running on network devices
	- response to a request, a network service gives data
	- **Networks have 4 Essential Features**-
		- **Devices**
			- messages are sent between devices on the network
		- **Medium**-
			- a path is a way to connect various devices; it may transmit messages from one device to the next
		- **Message**-
			- messages or units of data are passed from one device to the next
		- **Rules**-
			- the way messages are delivered, directed, received and understood is governed by rules or agreements (protocols)
	- **Network Devices**-
		- **Types of Network Devices**
			- **End Device**-
				- the piece of equipment that is the source or destination of communication
				- such as computers, laptops, servers, workstations, network printers, VoIP phones and mobile devices
				- typically the sole devices with which users interact (PDAs, smartphones, scanners)
			- **Intermediary Device**-
				- end users are linked through these devices
				- messages are passed through intermediary devices based on the target host address until they reach their destincation
		- **Physical Media**-
			- all network devices need some sort of physical medium to communicate
			- because physical qualities of each network media vary, different encoding methods are used
			- process of converting data to signals in physical media is called encoding (electric, light, or electromagnetic energy)
			- **Types of Physical Media**-
				- **Copper Media**-
					- **Signal Type**- electrical pulses
					- **Speed**- starting from 100Mbps
					- **Comparative cost**- least expensive
					- **Typical use**- short distance, usually Local Area Network (LAN) up to 500m
				- **Fibre-optic Media**-
					- **Signal Type**- light pulses
					- **Speed**- starting from 1000 Mbps
					- **Comparative cost**- most expensive (more expensive than wireless)
					- **Typical use**- long-distance trunks and LAN
					- **Used in two modes**- single-mode and multimode
						- **Single-Mode**-
							- small core
							- less dispersion
							- suitable for long-distance apps up to 100km
							- lasers are used as the light source often within campus backbones for distances of several thousand metres
							- ![[Pasted image 20250922212037.png]]
						- **Multimode**-
							- larger core than single-mode
							- allows more significant dispersion, meaning loss of signal
							- used for distance up to 2km
							- uses LEDs as light source often with LANs or distances of a couple hundred metres within campus network
							- ![[Pasted image 20250922212125.png]]
				- **Wireless Media**-
					- **Signal Type**- electromagnetic waves
					- **Speed**- starting from 10 Mbps
					- **Comparative cost**- expensive (cheaper than fibre-optic)
					- **Typical use**- multiuse based on frequency and available spectrum width can be used globally
					- ![[Pasted image 20250922212225.png]]
			- **Choosing suitable media**-
				- how far a signal can travel across a medium
				- the location where the media will be placed
				- the amount of data to be transferred and the speed at which it will be transmitted
				- cost of infrastructure (media or installation)
	- **Network Sizes**-
		- networks can be in different sizes
		- most different significanes between sizes are
			- the size of the region that has been covered
			- the total number of people who are connected
			- the number of services accessible and the sorts of services available
			- ![[Pasted image 20250922213748.png]]
		- **Unique Network Sizes**-
			- **Local Area Network (LAN)**-
				- scope usually limited to single building or group of buildings
				- frequently owned by the same company that owns the devices that are connected to it
				- provide substantially more bandwidth, in the range of hundreds of megabits per second
				- fewer errors and delays
				- ![[Pasted image 20250922213903.png]]
			- **Wide Area Network (WAN)**-
				- provide low-to-medium bandwitch services
				- made up of several international trunks controlled by several governments
				- different policies may be enforced
				- ![[Pasted image 20250922214028.png]]
			- **Metro Area Network (MAN)**=
				- larger than LAN, smaller than WAN
				- used for like uni campuses or a city
				- often managed by ISPs or government entities
			- **Internetwork**-
				- collection of separate multiple networks (LAN, WAN, MAN)
				- connected together
				- uses routers and standard protocols like TCP/IP to allow communication between those different networks

## Introduction Network Protocols
- protocols are regulations that anybody who connects with another must follow
- network protocols enable communcation between devices and provide a global standard that allows data to flow freely
- they allow the internet to function
- **Device Interaction on Network, must adhere to several protocols**
	- the messages format, including how much data to include in each part
	- the method through which intermediary devices exchange information regarding the destinations path
	- the procedure for dealing with update messages sent between intermediate devices
	- the procedure for starting and stopping communications between hosts
	- ![[Pasted image 20250923185130.png]]

- **Interaction of Protocols**-
	- example of using protocol suite in network communications is the interaction between web server and web browser
	- interacted uses several protocols and standards to exchange information
	- protocols ensure both parties recieve and understand the messages
		- **Network Access Protocols (Link Layer)**-
			- datalink management and physucal data transfer on the medium are the two major roles of network access protocols
			- packets from IP are formatted and sent over the medium using datalink management protocols
			- physical media standards and protocols regulate how signals are delivered over the media and how they are interpreted by receiving clients
			- how your physical device is connected to the network
			- example- ethernet, wifi, 5G etc
			- provides addressing at hardware level- MAC addresses
			- defines how the raw bits move across the medium- cables or radio waves
		- **Internet Protocol (IP) (Network Layer)**-
			- most widely used internetwork protocol
			- IP is in charge of encapsulating TCPs structured segments into packets
			- assigning suitable addresses and choosing hte optimal path to the destination host
			- provides logical addressing system (IP addresses) and routing
			- it doesnt guarantee delivery, order or reliability- it just tries to deliver packets from source to destination
			- basically just decides WHERE the packets go, but actually performing the action of transporting it
		- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) (Transport Layer)**-
			- protocol for managing individual talks between web servers and web clients
			- to get to destination client, TCP breaks the HTTP messages into smaller chunks called segments
			- TCP sits on top of IP to improve reliability
			- requires the 3-way handshake
			- guarantees ordered delivery of data
			- retransmits lost packets
			- manages flow control
			- wuthout TCP, high level appls would constantly have to handle missing/corrupted packets
			- this is the assurance system, making sure envelopes arrive, in order and intact
		- **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) (Application Layer)**-
			- standard protocol for communicating between a web server and web client
			- content and formatting of requests and answers sent between the client and server are defined by HTTP
			- runs on top of TCP
			- how browsers and servers communicate with each other
			- a client (browser) sends a request (GET /api/get_index.html) and server responds (200 + content)
			- relies on TCP to ensure all text, images or videos arive in the right order
			- its like the content of the message being delivered, instructions and data written in a shared language
		- ![[Pasted image 20250923185150.png]]
- **Protocol Suites and Industry Standards**-
	- early days of networking, each manufactorer had proprietry network equipment and protocols to support it
	- if corporation that bought equipment didnt need to exchange data outside its network then its fine
	- necessity for cross-platform standard for network communication became common as businesses wanted to do business with other companies using different network technologies
	- **Vendor-specific protocols**-
		- called proprietry
		- different devices from vendors are designed to interact with each other eventually
		- why common protocol standards are required
- **Network Models**-
	- each layer is responsible for specific responsibilites and is separate from others
	- the layers share data and rely on each other to receive and deliver input and output
	- **Reference Model**-
		- standard reference for network protocols and services to preserve consistency
		- its not meant to be an implementation specification or give enough information to adequately describe the network architectures services
		- OSI model is detailed description of the complete communication process
		- TCP/IP model shows how the protocol suite works and how it is used to communicate
	- **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI Model)**-
		- International Organisation for Standardisation created OSI model to give foundation for developing a set of open systems protocols
		- most widely known internetwork reference model
		- used for data network design, operation specifications and troubleshooting
		- **7 Layers**- from top to bottom
			- **7. Application Layer**-
				- acts a portal through which users and application processes can access network resources
				- closest to the user
				- provides network services directly to applications
				- examples- HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, POP3. DNS
				- this is the browser, email client, even slack uses this layer
			- **6. Presentation Layer**-
				- formats the data to be delivered to the application layer
				- ensures that data is in a format that the receiving app can understand
				- functions: encryption, compression, translation (ASCII <-> unicode, jpeg <-> BMP)
				- examples- SSL/TLS encryption, jpeg, mpeg, gif
				- this is where data gets packaged in readable/secure form
			- **5. Session Layer**-
				- enables the formation of sessions between processes operating on separate platforms
				- manages sessions between applications
				- functions: authentication, session establishment, teardown, checkpoints
				- example- when logging into website, session keeps you authenticated until log out
				- keeps track of the conversations- ie are we still connected
			- **4. Transport Layer**-
				- guarantees that messages are delivered without errors, in order and without duplication or losses
				- ensures the end-to-end delivery of data
				- functions: segmentation, error detection, flow control, reliability
				- protocols:
					- TCP- reliable, ordered, connection-oriented
					- UDP- fast, connectionless, no guarantee
				- the courier that makes sure packages arrive in order and intact
			- **3. Network Layer**-
				- in charge of the subnets functionning
				- determining which physical path data should travel depending on network circumstances, service priority and other criteria
				- decides where the packet goes via routing
				- functions: logical addressing, path selection, packet forwarding
				- protocols: IP (IPv4, IPv6), ICMP, RIP, OSPF, BGP
				- devices- routers
				- like a GPS that decides which routes the packets take to reach desitaion
			- **2. Datalink Layer**-
				- over the physical layer, datalink ensures error-free transport of data frames from one node to another
				- link setup and termination, frame traffic control, frame sequencing, frame aknowledgement, frame fault checking and media access management are all provided by it
				- handles node-to-node delivery on the same network
				- functions: MAC addressing, error detection (CRC), framing
				- protocols/tech- ethernet, wifi, PPP, ARP
				- devices- switches, birdges
				- its like the street signs and house numbers in neighbourhood
			- **1. Physical Layer**-
				- responsibile for sending and receiving unstructured raw bitstreams across a physical channel
				- lowest layer- the actual hardware
				- functions: transmitting raw bits (0s, 1s) over a medium
				- tech: cables, fiber, radio waves, hubs, repeaters
				- the actual roads, wires and signals carrying the message
			- ![[Pasted image 20250923185235.png]]
	- **Protocol Models**-
		- designed to resemble the structure of protocol suite closely
		- it specieis the functions at each later of the protocols within TCP/IP suit
		- Models are desinged to explain the protocols (different naming)
		- **4 Layers TCP/IP Model**
			- **4. Application**-
				- data is shown to the user
				- encoding and dialogue control
			- **3. Transport**-
				- supports cross-network connectivity between multiple devices
			- **2. Internet**-
				- optimum path through network is determined
			- **1. Network/Link Access**-
				- physical devices and media are under its control
		- TCP/IP is the model referenced in real world, while OSI isn't
