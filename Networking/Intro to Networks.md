## Network Foundation
- A set of devices connected to share resources
- Communicating in a network-centric world-
- **Network Architecture**- Architects must design the internet to suit the demands of the web and its users, must consider the buildings purpose and expected needs of the users
	- Fault tolerance, scalability, quality of service and security are all built into the internets design
	- **Fault Tolerance**- Reduces the effect f hardware or software failures and allows for speedy recovery, commonly done through redundancy where having duplicate connections/equipment between the source and destination
		- Have multiple instances of something in case another thing fails, like a router that can be used if another router goes down to ensure no interruption
		- Called **redundant connection** allowing for the alternative path to the non-down device
	- **Scalability**- Capacity to add more users, apps, tools and other networks without compromising the performance of the service being supplied to current users. 
		- Accomplished by developing the systems underlying phyusical infrastructure and logical design in a hierarchical design (ground up?)
		- Adding in new networks and users without interrupting the other users performance
	- **Quality of Service (QoS)**- Mechanism that manages a congested network.
		- Congestion occurs when bandwidth demands exceeds the network capability
		- QoS achieved by using a priortiy class system
		- Managed by the router, ensures that priorities are matched with the type of communication and its important to the organiseion
		- webpages can usually take lower priotity
		- streaming media will need priority to maintain a smooth uninterrupted user experioence
	- **Security**- Security must address 2 areas- network outages, misdirection and loss of personal or corporate finances must result from a network breach
		- **Network Infrastructure Security**- protecting network devices from outside contact
		- **Content Security**- Protecting the network content in various ways such as availability, confidentiality and integrity
		- Administratos can protext the network with software and hardware security and preventing physical access to network devices
		- Security measures protect the network from unathorised access
