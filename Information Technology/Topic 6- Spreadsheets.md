## Excel Spreadsheets
- Spreadhseets are used for solving calculations with rows and columns of data
- Each cell can hold different values for specific use cases-
	- **NUmbers**- can be used like regular ints, floars and percentage (45% eg)
	- **Text**- individual characters and not interpreted like a number. to make sure a number is represented as a ates (like a phone number, add ' at the start) '12323
	- **Dates/Times**- can be entered in many formats
		- interpreted depending on the regional settings of the computer
	- **Formulas**- start with the = sign
		- refer to values in other cells that may be used as operators and functions `=B3+B5`- this will get values from B3 and B5 cells and add them together
		- press F2 to edit a cell content, Esc to exit cell mode
- **Arithmetic Operators**- order of operators is important in the result of the calculation
	- order of them- brackets:`()`, negative number: `-`, percentage:  `%`, exponent:  `^`, multiply or divide: `* or /`, add or subtract: `+ or -`
	- When evaluating a formula, the order of operators determines the order of caluclations
	- Can select a cell and click 'Evaluate Formula' to see the step-by-step process for evaluating it
- **Specyfing range of cells**- can refer to a range of cells, and they must be in adjacent positions- rows, columns, blocks of rows/columns
	- can select a block of cells (B1, B2, B3, B4, C1, C2, C3, C4, D1, D2, D3, D4)
- **ABsolute and relative cell references**- copying a forumla into many cells
	- can find a forumla of cells already and then kind of copy the reference for another type of cells that are next to it (kinda weird??/)
	- absolute references do not change when they are copied
	- relative references are automatically adjusted as they are copied, just depends on the direction they are copied in
- **Formatting Cells**- better formatting can make the spreadsheet easier to understand
	- only changes how the value in the cell is displayed, not the actual value in the cell- eg could have the same value in each cell but displayed differently (64.2, 64.2000, 64.19)
	- **General**- no specific format, number of decimals displayed depends on the space available (column width)- 12,345.678
	- **Number**- two decimal places, a comma may optionally be used- 12,345.68
	- **Currency**- $, commas, 2 decimal places- $12,2345.68
	- **Accounting**- $, commas, 2 decimal places, sign and $ left justified- $12,345.68
	- **Scientific**- 2 decimal places, E, signed exponent- 1.23E+04
	- **Percentage**- 2 decimal places, trailing %- 0.05752 or 5.5752% woulc be 5.75%
- **Formatting Dates**- example 31-Jan-2020
	- **Short Date**- 31/01/2020
	- **Long Date**- Thursday, 31 January 2020
	- Can create own custom format- can do this from the 'Format Cells' display window
## Spreadsheet Functions
- Function is predefined formula that performs calculations using values in particular order, things like sum, average, count, max/min value of range of cells
	- return a single value which is the result of calculation
	- function is part of the formula of a cell
	- result of the function is displayed in the cell the forumla is in
- in the brackets after te function name there may be 0 or more arguments to determine specific things the function should do (providing how many cells will be i nthe range functions)
- **SUM**- add up a range of numbers and provide the total sum of them
	- `=SUM(B2:B6)`- all the cells added together between B2 and B6 cells
- **Average**- `=AVERAGE(B2:B6)`- the average of all the cells between
- **MIN**- `=MIN(B2:B6)`- the minimum value from the range given
- **MAX**- `=MAX(B2:B6)`- the max value fro mthe range given
- **COUNT**- `=COUNT(B2:B6)`- the number of non-blank cells in the given range
- blank or text cells are not included in the results from the functions
- **Date/Time Functions**- functions above work for numbers, need for date and time as importnat
	- the functions dont contain any arguements as they dont need to be supplied with any information, gets the date/time from the system
	- `=TODAY()`: the current date
	- `=NOW()`: the current date and time
	- can produce results to many decimal places, but numbers need to be nearest whole number or cent etc
	- `=ROUND(number, num-of-digits)`- the num-of-digits will specify amount of digits to round to, if it's a negative number then it will round to that many places from left of the decimal
		- - =ROUND(123456,-3) = 123,000
		- - =ROUND(123.49,0) = 123
		- - =ROUND(60.234,2) = 60.23
	- `=MROUND(number, multiplied)`- this rounds to the nearest multiple to the number
		- - =MROUND(A4,0.01) = (if A4 is 60.2353, result is 60.24)
		- - =MROUND(123.50,1) = 124
		- - =MROUND(123456,1000) = 123,000
- **IF Function**- using conditions to determine the result of a cell value, useful if the function can have different results depending on whether there are two or more alternatives to what the result could be (depending on other results)
	- `=IF(logical-test, value-if-true, value-if-false)`
	- eg `=IF(B1<B3, B1, B3)`- this would check if the value in B1 is less than B3 and if true then return B1 if not then return B3
	- **Nested IFs**- nesting an IF statement in another which can create more dynamic and complex results `=IF(B2<0, "Negative", IF(B2=0,"Zero","Positive"))`- this will check if B2 is less than 0 and return Negative if true, if false then it will check if B2 = 0 and if it does then return Zero, if false then return Positive
- **VLOOKUP Functions**-
