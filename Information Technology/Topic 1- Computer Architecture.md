## Information
- **Data**- data is meaningful information and represenst values associated
- **Knowldge**- tyhings we know
- Methods for conveying info- sound, text, image, light, moving pics
- IT is computers to store, retrieve, transmit and maniuplation data usually in context of business
- **Computer**- electronic device that operates under control of instructions using memory, accept data input and process the data according to specific rules nad then produce information output and store information for future useage- PC, mobile device, IOT
- User-> Application sogftweare -> System software -> Hardware

##  Computer Hardware
- Parts that make up the actual desktop of a computer- memeory module, processor, battery, sound card, processor, heat sink and fan, hard disk, integrated sound ports and circuitry
- **Von Neumann architecture**- Electronic digital computer with subvisions of processing unit consiting of rithmetic logic unit and processor registers, control unit containing instruction register and program counter and a memory to store both data and instructions andinput/output mechanisms.
- **Motherboard**- Conects components together, many different connectors to connect to external devices such as monitors, keytboards and speakers. Data wires connect components together called **BUS**
	- **Bus**- essentially the wires that are connecting all the different components on the motherboard to work
- **Adapter Cards**- Internal expansion card that allows computer to commuinicate with other preipheral, like video cards or monitors- extensions to allow for more components to the computer
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**- Need this for all decision making for the computer, performs buillions of instructions per second, multiple instructions at same time and need CPU as controlled by a porgram.
	- Speed measured in gigahertz GHz, clock speed (VERY FAST)
	- **Processors**- Componenets of the CPU
		- Control unit- directos and coodirdations most of the operations in computer
		- arithmetic logic unit ALU- performs arithmetic comparson and other operations
		- registers- temporary storage (smaller and fastest), smaller and faster than the cache
	- Input device registers data and the CPU does the processing and then does the output- control unit tells arithmetic logic unit ALU what opoeration to perform on the data and the ALU stores the result in an ouput register, the control unit moves the data between these registers, the ALU and memory
	- Machine cycle will each instruction repeats 4 steps
		- Fetch instructions and data by control unit
		- interpret by control unit
		- perform calculation by ALU
		- Store results
	- **Memory**- Data representation in bits and bytes binary
		- Electronic components that store
			- Instructions- waiting to be executed by the processor
			- Data needed by those instructions
			- Results of processing the data
		- Address of each stored byte
		- **access a memeory address**-
			- **Logical addresses**- Theres are essentially virutal addresses made by the program that is running, is it used as a reference to access the physical memeory location by the CPI. Memory management unit MMU is used to map the logical address to the corresponding physical address. Page table is data structure used by virtual memeory system to store the mapping between virtual and physical
			- **Physuical addresses**- Physica location of required data in memeory. Never directly deals with physical locatioin just the logical location associated to thge physical. This is why the logical needs to be mapped to the physical
		- Types memeory-
			- Volatile- needs power to retain, power of machine off and gone
				- Static RAM (SRAM)- expensive, low power cost- CPU cache, less frequently reenergised, expensive- computer needs to store data somewhere while CPU is processing it- in RAM
				- Dynamiuc RAM (DRAM)- cheaper, higher power cost computer memory, constant reenergised
			- Non-vlatile- holds conent when not power
				- ROM (Read only memory)
				- Flash memeory
		- Main memory vs CPU cache-
			- 3 levels of cache from CPU to main memory
			- Each level is slower as is closer to the main memory, so data that is needed quicker will be stored in closer to CPU cache
			- Things like opening an application will use RAM and once turn the computer off the application is killed, so once reboot it will need to restard
			- ROM is used for things like data storage on disks and USBs
- Haredware COmponent- RAM
	- Computer needs to store data somewhere while its being processed by CPU
	- RAM is very fast and not presistent (data gone when computer turned odd)
	- modern computer have between 4GB - 32GB RAM
- Hardware component- ROM
	- Read only memory
	- persistent and not erased when loses power
	- common type of ROM is DVD-ROM (a movie is saved on the disk)
	- Repgoram ROM chips like EPROM
- Hardweare component- Harddrive
	- much higher capacity than RAM but a lot slower
	- More expensive byut much faster than hard drives
	- connect to the motherboard via SATA cables
	- persistent remembers after reboot
	- the platter rotates around 7200 RPM and arm must move out to read the data on the disk
	- high latency, takes time for arm to move into position to read data from platter
- Hardware component- SSD
	- Sokid state drive used like hard drives to store long term data
	- Uses instantly accessible memroy chips
	- No moving parts (like a arm or spinning disc)
	- Low latency because dont have arm moving to get data
	- More expensive per GB than hard drives but cost is rapidly decreasing, hard drives will be repaced by SSD within years
	- Much more solid connection of a stable hardware, compared to a disk with an arm
- Hardware Components- optical drive
	- Use lasers to read digital data from plastic disk
	- CD-ROM disks
	- Compact disk coudl store 700MB data, DVD 4-9GB and blueray gfor 25GB etc used for more HD
	- Less popular because of low performance and physical size, because hard drives can store way more and take up less space
- Hardware- External peripherals
	- COmponents that live outside the computer chassis
		- MOnitor/screen- provicdes visual output to user
		- keyboard/mouse- allow user to provide input

	- PCI Express
		- Peripeheral component interconnect express
		- high speed serial computer expansion BUS standard designed to replace older PCI and bus standards
		- Common motherboard interface for PC graphics cards and hard disk, WIFI and ethernet
		- x16 for graphics cards, 4x for RAID cards, x1 for lowe speed like sound cards
		- very fast and comes in multiple sizes
		- RAIDs Used for different cards like data managing multiple hard drves
		- RAIDs are used for data redundency if data can be mirrored to ensure data is preserved in case of a drive failure
	- SATA
		- Used to connect hard drives and SSDs to the motherboard
		- computer bus interface connects host bus adapters to mass storage devices like hard disk drives, optical drives and SSD
	- M.2 connector-
		- used to connect SSDs directly to motherboard
		- use SATA or PCIe as communication protocol
	- VGA-
		- used for display, but replaced by HDMI
	- Parallel port-
		- used for printers, USB and network printing better
	- Game port- 
		- used for jsticks and other gamepades, replaced by USB
	- PCI/AGP
		- obseleted by PCI express
	- Speed comparisons-
		- SSD using PCIe- 0.025 ms
		- SSD using SATA- 0.05ms
		- Hard drive using SATA
- **Transistor**- logic gate that allows electricity to pass through- 0/1
	- Electrical flow through gate and the silicon will insulate the transistor to be on
	- PMOS- swittches on when lower voltage
	- NMOS- switches on when high voltage
	- Gates-high voltage (1), low voltage (0)- the way for electricity to flow from one end to the other with the gates, the two inputs will determine by the logic if the output is a 1 or 0
		- NAND Gates (not AND)- opposite of AND, if both inputs are both 1 then output 0, otherwise outputs 1
		- AND- both inputs are 1 then output 1 otherwise output 0
		- OR- if any of the input is one then it outputs 1
		- XOR (exclusive OR)-  if two inputs are different then output 1, otherwise 0
	- Using symbols to symbolise what type of gate something is
	- **Half adder**- half adder has two inputs and then two ouputs which are the, takes single bit numbers and doesnt take the CARRY from previous sum. These are the two outputs where it will determine if the output for both is a 1 or 0
		- **Sum (S)**- the results of the two binaries that are input together eg 1 + 0 = 1
		- **Carry (C)**- the left over logic bit, so if 1 + 1 = 0 SUM with CARRY of 1 (in binary so cant have a 2, needs to carry over)
- Data representated by binary 0/1
	- Decimal system is base 10 0-9
	- Octet is 8 bits long = 1 byte
	- Word is a basic unit storage that uses 64 bits
	- **Hexadecimal**- Base 16 0-F
		- 1 hex digit is exactly 4 bits
		- 1 byte is 2 hex digits- very easy for larger numbers as well
		- 0-9, A(10)-F(15)
		- hex is often denoted by starting with 0x
	- **ASCII**- the standard for things to mean the same thing across different encodings- "A" == 00100100 (probs)- uses 1 byte per character
		- Table to view it all
	- Unicode- 1 byte per character only allows 256 possible characters
		- UTF-16 used 2 bytes per character
	- **Images**- written in hex using 6 characters (3 numbers in hex) to represent RGB
		- the different brightness levels of RGB generate different pixel colors
		- each pixel on the screen comprises of three small dots of compounds called phosphors surrounded by a black mask
	- **Data types**- types of data we want to store so need to tell the computer what we want to store
		- Integer- whole numbers, usually 4 bytes long
		- char- single characters 'G' usually 1 byte long
		- string- sequence of chatacters
		- float- decimal numbers, normally 4 bytes
		- double- 8 bytes long float
	- **Computer files**- different files to be decoded to do something- zip, gif, htmll, jpg, php etc
		- File compression to make the file a lot smaller so it can move around easier and then recreate it
		- important to be able to identify what type of file it is so the computer can know what program to open to use the file
		- Two main files
			- **Binary files**- include EXE, DOXS, JPEG, PNG, BMP, ZIP, WAV, MP3 format 
				- Wav- waveform audio file format, lossless audio format that does not compress original anolog audio recording
				- Zip- file format to compress one or more files together into a single location
				- bmp - graphics image file to store bitmap digital images
				- Jpeg- saved using lossy JPEG compression
				- mp3 - lossy audio, digital audio file that has been compressed to manageable size for storage, streaming and download
				- png - portable network graphic, lossless compressed image format
				- - Exe- executable for windows, standard file extension used by windows programs
				- - docx- word document contains text, newer version of Doc
			- **Plain text**- TXT, HTML
				- - txt - standard text document containing plain text
		- File types have special bytes near start of the file to help identiofy the file type if file extension is missing or incorrect
		- File compression allows files to take up less spave that it would typically
			- **Lossless compression**- file can be compressed into smaller file and later decompressed back into original file without loss of data
				- This is done by creating a dictionary of common phrases or things in the file, so words/senteces or common patterns are converted to singular digits etc- ZIP, PNG, 7z files
			- **Lossy compression**- file is compressed by removing data and canot be reversed
				- Jpeg as iomage quality is reduced in a way tat cannot be undone, same with MP3
				- Compression depends on the algorithm being used, how much data is in patterns, and if the file is alreadyu compressed
	- **Computer algorithm**- Input and then rules happen which creates an output
		- Set of instructions for performing computation for solivng a problem
