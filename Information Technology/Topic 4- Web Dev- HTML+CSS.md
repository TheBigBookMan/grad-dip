- **WWW World Wide Web**- is information system where documents and other web resources are identified by **uniform resource locaters (URL)** which can be interlinked by hypertext and are accessible over the internet
- Internet is global network of networks, while the web is a collection of information that is accessed via the intenet
- WWW is most common known network, but there are more like a military network and education networks
- **4 steps of web development**- 
	- Developng a website with tools
	- deploying the website on a web server
	- transmitting data via the internet
	- viewing the website via web brwosers/apps
## HTML 
- **Hyper text markup language (HTML)**- Standard language for creating websites using plain text files containing ASCII characters
	- The files contain **tags** which have special meaning in the HTML stadard, HTML is controlled by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
	- Currently at HTML 5 and is aiming to reduce the dependence on external add-on programs like Flash and ActiveX
	- HTML doc is a text file but with tags to distinguish specific elements and is compatible with web brwosers
	- **Document Object Model (DOM)**- webpage consists of elements that indicate to the browser the structure of the webpage, HTML is built on top of it
		- Structured like a tree, where the Document -> Root html -> body etc. 
	- Webpages source code contains text marked up wih the HTML tags that sintruct the browser how to display that content.
	- Three parts to a document
		- Doctype- the version of HTML using
			- `<!DOCTYPE HTML>` represents that this document will be using HTML5 (dont need the 5)
		- Head- the metadata of the document
			- `/<head></head>` is the metadata element tags and you would have the metadata descriptions within this
			- This data helps search engines, provides a title for the page and extra information that may help tjhe brwoser, tag is often used for code like JS and CSS
		- Body- the displayable content
			- `<body></body>` has the display elements inbetween these tags to be displayed in the browser. Common tags within the body
				- `<b>`- bold text
				- `<i>`- italic text
				- `<p>`- paragraph
				- `<u>`- underline text
				- `<h1>`- heading
				- `<h2><h3>etc`- subheading
				- `<br/>`- break line for page (doesnt need closing tag)
				- `<a>`- anchor to link to other pages
	- **Tags**- elements can have attrivutes which provide more information about a tag
		- Usually like `<element attribute="value"`
		- **id**- a unique identifier for an element to be able to select it later with CSS and JS
		- **Void element**- dont have a closing tag, just a /- `<br/><img/><input/>` etc
		- **Table**- can contain nything that you can put into an HTML document, like text, graphics, videos and nested tables
			- `<caption>Text</caption>`- give the table a heading
			- `<th>Header text</th>`- give the table a column or row heaing
			- `<tr><td>Cell text</td></tr>`- tr is for a row and the td is for data within that cell... can also put the th in the td as a heading
			- `<td colspan="2"</td>`- showing that you want the colum to be 2 columns wide 
			- `<td rowspan="2"</td>`- showing you want the row to be 2 rows wide
			- `<table border="3" width="80%">`- styling the table a bit and saying how wide of the screen you want it to be
	- **Hyperlink**- click on to be taken to another page
		- `<a href='www.your/link.com'>Click</a>`- this take you to an exteral URL website
		- `<a href='your_file.pdf'>Click here</a>`- this opens a local file
		- Absolute URL is full URL `www.google.com/welcome`
		- or relative URL `/clients/clientId`- this is relative to the current page
			- `/mypage.com`- in web root
			- `../mypage.com`- in parent directory
			- `mypage.com`- in current directory
			- These are cponverted to absolute URLS by the browser
		- Can do hash routing, where you jump to a section on a page `<a href="#idofsection">Click</a>` the hash id in the href needs to link to an ID on the page
	- **Image**- `<img src="my_image.png" width="20  height="20"/>` shows the image that is within this location and gives a height and width of  20px
		- src attribute is the URL of the image
	- **Lists**- to be able to list items and each have the items listed like `<li>Text</li>` can nest these lists as well
		- **unordered List (dot points)**- `<ul></ul>` this will list without any ordering, just dot points next to it
		- **ordered list (numbered)**- `<ol></ol>` this will list with numbers to create an order
	- **HTML Entities**- if you want to show a html tag in content as the actual tag string itself
		- need to use the actual ascii eg "<" = &#60 
	- **Comments**- `<!-- -->` used to be able to comment (doesnt impact actual code, just human readable stuff)
## CSS
- **Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)**- used for styling a webpage
- Describes the look and formatting, its used to separate the content from presentation and so we can attach things like font colours out of HTML and into CSS
- Usually be in a different file .css
- `selector {property: value;}`
- **Selector**- used to target elements
	- `.className`- targets all elements with class='className'
	- `#idname` - targets the element with the id='idName'
	- `*`- selects all elements
	- `elementName`- selects all elements that are named 'elementName'
	- `elementOne, elementTwo` - selects all elements which are either of those elements
- **CSS Types**- you can add in CSS in different ways to the HTML content
	- **Inline**- `<div style="color:red">This text is red</div>`- it is used as the same inline as whatever the html code is
	- **Internal**- within the `<style></style>` tags that are within the `<head></head> tags` in the HTMl you can put it in there `<style type="text/css>h1 {color: blue;}</style>`
	- **External**- in a separate file with extension .css, need to link it within the `<head><link rel='stylesheet' type='text-/css' href='css/link_to_file.css'/></head>`- this will then be able to import the css file and the matching of elements can happen
- **CSS Comment**- use the `/* comment here */`
- **Adding styles**- using CSS to create specific styling for the html elements
	- **Text Color**- need to use US Spelling- color, can use either color names (red, blue), hex value (#000000, #1111111), rgb (rgb(0,0,224))
	- **CSS Backgrounds**- can add in different properties for bakground
		- Color- `background-color: green;`
		- Image- `background-image: url("url/here/pic.jpg"`);
		- Shorthand- `background: blue url(link.jog) no-repeat left top;`
	- **Font**- Properties for font styling
		- Family- `font-family: Arial;`
		- Size- `font-size: small;`
		- Weight- `font-weight: bold;`
	- **Box model**- box wrapping around every html element consisting of margin, border, padding and content
		- Content- where text and images appear
		- Padding- area around the content
		- Border- border around the padding and content
		- Margin- outside the border
	- **CSS List**- apply styling to lists
		- Unordered- `<ul style="list-style:circle"></ul>`- to make the dots a circle
		- Ordered- `<ol style="list-style:lower-roman></ol>`- make the numbers in roman numerals
		- Image icon- `<ol style="list-style-image:url("link/to/image.png")></ol>`
	- **Tables style**- 
		- `table, th, td {border: 1px solid black;}`
	- **Display- block/inline**- 
		- **Block**- take up the whole line like a div and h1
		- **Inline**- take up as much as space as content like a span- cannot specify width or height to inline element
	- **CSS Overflow**- decide what to do with content when it starts to go outside an element
		- `overflow: visibile;`- overflow is not clipped and renders outside the elements box
		- `overflow: hidden;`- the rest of the overflow is hidden from view
		- `overflow: scroll;`- scrollbar is added to see rest of content
		- `overflow: auto;`- only adds scrollbar when necessary
	- **Compound selectors**- target specific elements without giving a class or id
		- `#navbar a {color: green;}`- this matches all the anchors that are children to the id navbar
		- `p.sidebar a {color: blue;}`- this selects all anchros that are children in any p tags with the class 'sidebar'
	- **CSS Precendence**- When there are multiple CSS properties applicable to an element, these rules apply
		- Inline styles (HTML style attribute) will override internal styles (CSS styles) and external style files
		- Internal styles will override external styles
		- CSS properties with the `!important` flag will override all other properties
	- **CSS Units**- Specify distances in CSS
		- **Pixels**- number of on-screen pixels- `width: 400px;`
		- **Percent**- percentage of the parent elements size- `width: 50%;`
		- **Em**- a special unit that s based on the size of letter M- `width: 5em;`
	- **User agent stylesheet**- browsers have a built-in style sheet they apply by default and you can override this, some browsers have different defaulst- causes developers to provide CSS resets for browsers to start from scratch
	- **Inspect Element**- inspect the pages CSS

## Webpage Design
- **Layout design**- websites are important and need goor navigation otherwise people leave
- Usually have this layout
	- **Header**- top of he webpage, contains logo, call to action and contact info
	- **Navbar**- on left or top of page, can have mu;tiple levels of navigation bars, sometimes content may need its own nav
	- **Main area**- content display
	- **Footer**- bottom of page, contains copyright notice, link to provacy policy, sitemap, logo, contant info, social media icons, email sign up form
- **Developing a webpage**- 
	- Have the main containr of content `<div class='containter'`
	- And then add in each division of the headerm navbar, conent and footer each having their unique id to that div
	- Can then specify the content for each section easier in the CSS file
	- `overflow: auto;` to the container div will get rid of whitespace
	- can give the background color to body as it will give the webpage more color
	- center the page `#container {max-width: 60em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;}` center the content into the middle with margins
	- navbar items will have links to the other pages and can inline them with a `#navbar li {text-align: center; display: inline;}` and then the anchros can be `#navbar a {display: inline-block; width: 5em; background-color: yellow;}`
