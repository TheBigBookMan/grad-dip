-   **Dynamic content**- usually websites dont have any change when a user inputs something, so important to create dynamic webages where they can change based on some sort of user input
    -   **Client-side programming**- executes inside the browser and can do this without reloading the page, mainly javascript- used to control dynamic website content
    -   **Server-side programming**- executes on the web server and results (usually in html format) are sent to web browser, the code is never present on the browser, but the results from the code show up on the browser
-   **PHP**- Server side language which means 'Personal Home Page' now 'PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor'
    -   server must be configured to run PHP and its primary job is to generate HTML for web browsers, can also generate other file types like iamges etc
    -   does not need compiling or anything extra, just files in the web directory
    -   file end with .php which tells the IDE to to execute the code with the PHP interpeter
    -   any code in the HTML that has PHP in it will be executed on the server and the result of the php will return within the html which is shown in the browser
    -   `var_dump()` function takes a variable and ouptuts its value and data type, handy when dont know data type or value
    -   `==` matches the values while `===` matches the value and data type
    -   Two ways to get output with PHP-
        -   `echo $vairable;`
        -   `print $variale;`
    -   **constant variable**- a simple value which cannot be changed during the script
        -   `define(nameOfVariable, valueOfVariable, case-sensitive);`
        -   case-sensitive is default false
    -   **functions**- some functions return a value that can be stored in a variable or directly display result in browser
    -   `<?php ?>` for any php code within a file, needs to be in html as well
    -   **logical operators**-
        -   `And` = and
        -   `Or` = or
        -   `xor` = xor
        -   `&&` = and
        -   `||` = or
        -   `!` = not
    -   **do, while loop**- executes a code first and then loops through, while normal while loop just executes
    -   **string using ""**- convert escape sequences into their equivalent like `" hey there\n hwy"` will give the new line with `\n`. also converts variables into their values
    -   **Inlcude statement**- important code from other files ito the current one
        -   put code like the navbar in the include statement and it can appear onto the other files
        -   `include "page/path.php";` have this in the php section and it will import the php
        -   can have variables declared before the include and then that works in the included file as well- good for dynamic content like page title which can happen on any page
    -   **Forms**- browser send extra data to the web server in the URL
        -   GET parameters are within the URL- query string `mypage.php?var1=awe&var2=asd`, limit of around 2000 characters-- never for sending sensitive data
        -   query string contains set of key=>value pairs separated by &
        -   When retrieving in backend, good to use `isset($_GET['varName'])` and check if true to first get the passed parameter and echo back validation if they did not pass a parameter
        -   POST parameters are passed through the HTTP POST method
        -   POST data is invisible to others as its embedded within the body of the HTTP request, and no limits to amount of information to send-- impossible to bookmark page because the parameters are not in the URL
        -   `<form method="GET" action="submit.php">` and add the input elements inbetween open and clsoe tag
	- **Checkboxes**- `<input type="checkbox" name="box1" id="box1" />`
		- checkboxes only send to the server if they are checked
		- so can use the `isset` function to check if it is set and then produce a value and then an else statement for if it is not checked and return a value
	- **Radio**- `<input type="radio" name="fruit" id="b1" value="Apple" />` repeat with different id and value
		- have the labal match the id `<label for="b1">Apple</label>`
		- use the `isset()` function and then can determne what to do based on the radio, can use if/else to deteremine it
	- **Multiple Checkboxes**- similar to regular checkboxes but used if you want to be able to select multiple checkboex
		- `<input type="checkbox" name="fruit[]" id="b1" />` need the square brackets in the name attribute
		- after the `isset($_GET)` function on the get request, then run a foreach over the list of multiple checkboxes
		- foreach will only work on each checkbox that was checked
## Cookies and Databases
- HTTP reqiests are stateless meaning that once the PHP files are finished executing, then all the variables are deleted and forgotten
- **Data PErsistence**-
	- Client Side- clients can remember data via **cookies**, they are small pieces of data the server sends to the browser in the header
		- browser sends the cookies back each time it requests a page and is used for tracking users as they browse
		- cookies are stored on the client compujter
		- simple a piece of text data taht is stored in the browser and issued by the server in a HTTP header, the browser will keep track of the cookie and send to the server inside every HTTP request
		- send a cookie to browser using php `setcookie("cookieName", "cokieValue", unixtimestamp)` before the `<html>` tag- this defines a cookie to be sent along with the rest of the HTTP headers. must be sent before any output from your script (protocol restriction) and this requires that you place calls to this function prior to anyu output
		- the unix timestamp will determine when the cookie will expire
		- can delete the cookie by setting the timestamp to the past, and setting the value to nothing
		- retrieve the cookie value using `$_COOKIE['value']` as it is a superglobal variable and can be accessed anywehere
		- good to use `isset($_COOKIE['keyName'])` in an if else staement to make sure whatever the cookie does is properly authenticating
		- if a shopping cart example, adding any new additions to the cookie wll have the productId as a string divided by a comma with productIds
		- grab the string and explode() by the commas and then loop over each one in the array and call the DB
	- Server Side- Store data in a SQL database on the server
		- can also store data in a text file which is good for small volumes of data
		- both methods are reasonably secure from tampering by clients
		- PHP can read and write to files
			- `fopen("file_path.txt", "type")`- can either read R (starts at beginning of file), write W (if file exists it will be over written and any existing contents deleted, if not exists it will be created), append A (used to add new data to an existing file, if not exist then file will be created)
			- `fread()`- reads from an open file
			- `fwrite()`- write to an open file
			- `fclose()`- closes an open file pointer, file must be `fopen()` before being able to close
		- can write things like new lines as well like `fwrite($file, "\r\n")`
		- Problem with file storage is its unsuitable for large or complex datasets
			- **Corruption issues**- if two php scripts try to edit a file at te same time, or server crashses while editing the file
			- **Performance issues**- lacks data indexing and caching
		- Daqtbases used for concurrency and crash recovery to the database server
		- **PHP data objects (PDO)**- PDO librarby consists of functions to connect and interact with different database servers
	- **SQLIte Datbaase**- use PDO to access SQLite
		- can use phpLiteAdmin as a GUI to see the database rather than command line
