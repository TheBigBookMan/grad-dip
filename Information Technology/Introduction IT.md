## Big steps in IT?
- **Digitizing Information**- Representing information as numbers, eg books having the ABSN which represents that specific book
	- The big break through was getting machines to be able to read the numbers and differentiate the input into categorised outputs
- **Stored Program COmputers**- Problem with first machines that could process digitized information was it was all hardwarr
	- The big break was creating the first lots of "software" programs that used bits instead of wires for memory
	- Building CPU to intepret instructions for the computers
- **Switch to transistors**- Moving from large vacuum tubes to the smaller transistors made computers much smaller, cheaper and more reliable.
- **Integrated Circuits**- Being able to assemble all of the smaller pieces together (trasistors, resistors, capacitors and wires)- all combined using the SIlicon Technology
	- Being able to print on the wiring onto the silicon wafers, cheaper cost for simple or complexity of the circuit
- **Personal Computers (PC)**- Now having smaller devices that could make computations with the integrated circuits, there was the introduction to having a computational machine within ones home or on person
- **Internet**- Being able to connect computers together through a network that allowed common communication protocol TCP/IP- a network of networks
	- Dial-up modem
	- Mainly sending of email and files, not much other functionality
- **HTTP and WWW**- Online center where everyone could access documents, images and other resources and everyone can enjoy access to information
- **Layered software development**- Being able to build amazing software on hardware and giving endless possibilities
	- Being able to build programs that can serve multiple purposes

## Aspects of IT
- **Computers**- come in all types 
	- Processors- More specific type of computers embedded in things like ovens, phones, music players, IoT etc
		- Contains small CPU, small memory (cache) and connceted through input/output devices
		- Different devices have different amount of specs and hardware
	- Advanced RISM Machine (ARM)- Even more specific for simpler items like microwaves
		-  Usually has very small and simple tasks to do repetitively
- **Software**- CPU in the computer will run programs very rapidly and with great accuracy
- **Algorithms**- Solving problems based on an input/ouput and set of rules, has 5 importat properties to make it an algorithm
	1. **Input Specified**- Specifying what the computation is given as data
	2. **Output Specified**- Specifying what the computation will produce as a result
	3. **Definite**- The whole process is spelled out unambigously
	4. **Effective**- It is within the abilities of the agent following the instructions
	5. **Finite**- Agent will eventually finish the computation, giving the right answer or stop and report that none is possible
