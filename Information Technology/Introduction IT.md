## Big steps in IT?
- **Digitizing Information**- Representing information as numbers, eg books having the ABSN which represents that specific book
	- The big break through was getting machines to be able to read the numbers and differentiate the input into categorised outputs
- **Stored Program COmputers**- Problem with first machines that could process digitized information was it was all hardwarr
	- The big break was creating the first lots of "software" programs that used bits instead of wires for memory
	- Building CPU to intepret instructions for the computers
