## Fundamentals of AI and ML
### Basic AI concepts and terminologies
- **AI**- simulation of human intelligence by machines like computer systems
	- systems that perceive, reason, learn and act based on data performing tasks like humans would with human-intelligence, pattern recognitions, deciison making, problem solving
- **ML**- subset of AI focusing on building systems that learn from data to make predicitons or decisions
	- not being explicilty programmed, but algorithms detecting patterns and relationships in data to improve performance over time
- **Deep Learning**- subset of ML
	- involves neural networks that has many layers (deep)
	- can automatically learn features and representations within large amounts of data
	- common in image recognition, speech processing and natural language understanding
- **Neural Networks**- set of algorithms designed to recognise patterns
	- inspired by the structure of human brain
	- layers of interconnected nodes where each connection carries a weight and data flows through from input to output
	- each node may change the input in a certain wayu and weigh on where the next node will be fired
- **Computer Vision**- field of AI focused on allowingm achines to be able to detect through visual information like images and videos
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**- deals with the interaction between human language and machines provessing by understanding, interpreting and generating
- **Model**- used in ML, it has been trained on data to make predictions specifically from the data trained on, does not require being programmed to do the task
- **Algorithm**- takes an input and then a process of logic is performed to create a specific output
- **Training**- feeding data to the ML to be trained on for better pattern recnognition and creating relationships between the data
- **Inference**- process using trained ML models for making predictions on specific tasks ased on new, unseed data
- **Bias**- systematic errors in ML model predicitons due to prejudice assumptions during the learning process
- **Fairness**- ensuring ML models predictions are impartial and do not favor any group over others
- **Fit**- how well the ML models prediction match the actual data. 
- **Overfitting**- occurs when the model learns the data too well and performs poorly on unseen data because it just uses the trained data
- **LLM**- type of deep learning model trained on vast amount of text data to understand human-like-language (NLP)
- **Similarities between AI, ML, DL**-
	- enable machines to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence
	- use data to make decisions
	- using pattern recognition from trained data to make the predictions
- **DIfferences between AI, ML, DL**-
	- AI- broadest concept, encompassing any machine with human-like intelligence
	- ML- subset of AI focussing on algorithms that learn from data to make deicisions
	- DL- using neural networks with multiple layers to model intricate data patterns
- **Types of Inferencing**-
	- **Batch**- processing large number of data inputs at once, suitable for tasks where real-time responses aren't necessary
		- like having large chunks sent in periods
	- **Real-time**- data inputs individually as they arrive, these are immediate predictions or decisions, essential for instant responses
- **Types of Data**-
	- **Labeled**- data comes with tags and labels for annotation, this allows for identifying correct and incorrect output for each input- supervised learning
	- **Unlabeled**- no explicit tags, this is used in unsupervised learning to discover hidden patterns
	- **Tabular**- structured data organised in tables with rows and columns, common in databases and spreadsheets
	- **Time Series**- data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals, used in forecasting and trend analysis
	- **Image**- visual data formats like JPEG/ PNG and used in computer vision tasks
	- **Text**- data in textual format, such as documents, social media posts- used in NLP
	- **Structured**- organised and easily searchable often stored in relational databases
	- **Unstructured**- without predefined format, such as videos, images and free-text documents
- **Types of Learning**-
	- **Supervised**- using labeled data to explicilty tell the ML model what is correct and incorrect- regression (linear like stocks) or classification (categorical)
	- **Unsupervised**- uses unlaeled data to indeitfy patterns between the input and create clustering and associated tatsks (groups common inputs together to identify some sort of common pattern)
	- **Reinforcement**- agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards, used in robotics and game playing

### Identify practical use cases for AI
- **AI Is appropriate use case**- can enhance decisions making, automatig repetitive tasks, scaling solutions efficiently
	- **Assist human decision making**- 
		- **Healthcare**- ML models can analyse medical images (x-rays, MRI) to assist doctors in diagnosing conditions with higher accuracy
		- **Finance**- analyse stock market trends, help financial analysts make more informaed investment decisions
		- **Custtomer support**- NLP powered chatbots can resolve common customer issues, leaving human agents for more complext cases
	- **Solution Scalability**- 
		- **Personlised marketing**- based on tracking human behaviour, can tagert individuals more specifically based on their browsing
		- **Supply chain optimization**- forecasting models can predict demand, optimize inventory and reduce waste
		- **Content moderation**- automatically filter inappropriate content on social media platforms, scaling moderation to millions of users
	- **Automation**-
		- **Manufactoring**- robots can utomate quality control and assembly processes
		- **Smart home automation**- optimize energy consumption by learning usage patterns and controlling devices accordingly
		- **Fraud detection**- real-time ML models can flag suspicious transactions for financial institutions
- **AI is not appropriate use case**- AI/ML not always best approach, can use traditional programming or rule-based systems
	- **Cost-benefit analysis**
		- **Small-scale projects**- cost of implementing ML slutions can outweigh the benefits if volume of data is insufficient or decisions are straightforward
		- **Limited data available**- not enough historical data to train an effective model, rule based approach might be more efficient
		- **Long development time**- if project requires immediate implementation, developing ML model too time consuming
	- **When specific outcome is needed**
		- If task requires precise, deterministic output rather than probabilistic prediction, ML not suitable. eg accounting, legal contract generation where accuracy is critical, deterministic algoprithms are preferable
