## Fundamentals of AI and ML
- **AI**- simulation of human intelligence by machines like computer systems
	- systems that perceive, reason, learn and act based on data performing tasks like humans would with human-intelligence, pattern recognitions, deciison making, problem solving
- **ML**- subset of AI focusing on building systems that learn from data to make predicitons or decisions
	- not being explicilty programmed, but algorithms detecting patterns and relationships in data to improve performance over time
- **Deep Learning**- subset of ML
	- involves neural networks that has many layers (deep)
	- can automatically learn features and representations within large amounts of data
	- common in image recognition, speech processing and natural language understanding
- **Neural Networks**- set of algorithms designed to recognise patterns
	- inspired by the structure of human brain
	- layers of interconnected nodes where each connection carries a weight and data flows through from input to output
	- each node may change the input in a certain wayu and weigh on where the next node will be fired
