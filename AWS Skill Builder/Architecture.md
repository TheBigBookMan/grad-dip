## Monolithic
- Tightly coupled services and components
- usually in this type, if one component fails then the whole application fails

## Microservices
- application components are loosely coupled
- if one component fails then the other components continue to work independently from one another

## Messaging and Queuing
- When services are queued up in an order to process a specific event- eg if first service takes action, and  then the second service takes action etc
- **Tightly coupled**- if any of the services in the queue take action and fail, then the whole process fails and throws errors
- **Loosely coupled (AWS do this)**- if one service fails then its isolated so the whole queue doesnt fail with it, the service that fails will create a queue of messages for the action and wait until the service is working again to process

## Serverless Computing
- running the code on a virtual server hosted in the cloud
- no provisioning or managing of the servers
- removes the need of having to host the server yourself
- **Step Functions**- orchestration for modern apps that breaks it into multiple steps, adding flow logic
	- define and manage the workflow of application independetly from busniess logic
	- ensure state for each step
	- creates a log of each step

## Containers
- great so you can run applications code on different environments as the code environment is saved within the image
- packaing code and dependencies into a single object
- great for reliability, scalability and security
- multiple instances of servers can manage the exact same code- great for scalability
- updating one block of code can then update all the instances through orchestration management when there are large amounts of servers hosting many containers

## Global Infrastructure and Reliability
- having the availability of your resources all the time due to AWS having many places where resources are stored so if one goes down, then the other place can serve the resources
- **Regions**- a geographic location, before choosing a region where you want resources to be stored, consider:
	- Compliance- requirements in the region that you must adhere by eg the data must remain within your country
	- Proximity- putting the resources closer to location of users to reduce any latency
	- Availability- checking if the services you want to use are available in the specific region you want
	- Pricing- different regions may require different costs so some are more expensive than others
- **Availability Zones**- Many data centers (availability zones) are in a region which can helpe to also split up the resources
	- availability zone is either a singular data center or a group of data centers
	- physically separate data centers within a region with independent ppower, cooling and networking
	- Always recommended to run across atleast 2 availability zones in a region
	- enhances fault tolerance and high availability by distrubiting applications across multiple AZs within a region
	- A region will contain minimum 3 avalability centers and these will be named like: region- North California (us-west-1), data center 1 (us-west-1a), data center 2 (us-west-1b), data center 3 (us-west-1c)
	- Use Load balancer to distribute traffic across AZs
	- use auto-scaling to adjust number of instances across AZs to maintain performacen and availability
- **Edge Locations**- being able to cache or store copies of your files into a closer location to where users are- using AWS Cloudfront as a content delivery network (CDN) and AWS Global Accelerator
	- **Cloudfront**- acts as the CDN delivering data 
	- **Global Accelerator**- directs traffic through AWS global network by providing static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to apps in one or more regions. Routes traffic to the optimal endpoint based on health, geography and policies
	- They are sites deteremined by AWS that are different from regions, usually metro areas and major cities arund the world that dont have an availability centre
	- good for if you want some particular data or files to be easier access to a certain location, than setting up a full region
	- good for if your developing in another country thats far from where the userbase is
	- Can use AWS Outposts which is setting up an edge location device to be closer to where you are (could be in your building etc)- on-premise data center
- **Use multiple Regions**-
	- **Disaster Recovery**- ensure business continuity by replicating apps and data across different regioins incase of region-wide failure another region can take over
	- **Business Continuity**- maitain operations during region-specific outages by having standby resources in another region
	- **Low Latency for end users**- deplyoing applications across multiple regions closer to end-users reduces latency
	- **Data soverignty**- comply with legal and regulatory requirements by storing and processing data within speicif regions
- **Wavelength Zones**- infrastructure deployments that embed AWS compute and storage services within telecommuncations providers dat centers at the edge of 5G network
	- ultra-low latency apps, like AR, VR and real-time gaming
	- brings AWS services closer to end-users on 5G networks so reduced latency
- **AWS Local Zones**- extend AWS regions by placing compute, storage, database and other services closer to larger population, industry and IT centers
	- apps requiring single-digit millisecond latency or local data processing
	- improved performance for latency-sensitive apps, compliance with local data residency requirements
## Working with AWS
- can work with the console in browser
- or the AWS CLI with scripts and easier typing for managing resources over using a GUI as less human error
- SDKs for any interaction with programming languages
- **Management Console**- web based interfact to manage AWS services
	- good for one time configurations, visusal monitoring, learning and experimentation
- **Command Line Interface**- manage services from CL
	- good for automation, integration with other applications, repetitive tasks
- **SDK**- language specific APIs interact with services
	-  good for automation, integration with other applications, repetitive tasks
- **Infrastructure as Code**- Cloudformation, terraform, AWS CDK
	- good for repeatable and consistent infrastructure provisioning, version control, and collab
- **Elastic Beanstalk**- platform as a service for deploying applications
- **OpsWorks**- configration management servce
- **CloudShell**- web based comman line
	-  good for automation, integration with other applications, repetitive tasks

## Networking
- create a VPC to manage the networking for all your applications and servers
- can have private for ones you dont want to be talking to clients or internet directly
- public for ones you do want to be talking to clients and itnernet directly
- control groups of servers with subnets that are groups of the IP addresses
- **Public facing- Internet Gateway** - 
	- directs traffic that flows through the network with **Internet Gateway (IGW)**
	- Internet gateway allows communication between instances in your VCP and the internet
	- **NAT Gateyway**- enables instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other servicew hile preventing internet from initating connections with the instances
	- without an internet gateway, no one can access the resources within the VPC
	- internet gateway is how your network can interact with the internet
- **Private facing**- 
	- don't want anyone from anywhere to reach resources through an internet gateway
	- **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**- 
		- securely connects on-premise network or individual devices to AWS cloud
		- site-to-site VPN for network-to-network connections by securely connecting on-premise network to your VPC (encrypted IPsec connections and supports redundatnt connections for high availability)
		- client VPN for individual users by securely connecting individual users to your VPC from any location (encrypted connetions, integration with ACtive Directory and other identity providers)
		- encrypted connections over the internet
	- use a Virtual Private Gateway which can create a **VPN** connection between a on-premises network to a private network and VPC
		- virtual private gateway is extra encryption and protection over any requests (VPN)
		- problem with VPN is it can still be slow because it is still run through a public network (just with encryption)
		- only comes through if its coming from an approved network
	- **AWS Direct Connect**- establush a completely private and dedicated fiber connection from data center to AWS
		- Physical line connecting your network to your AWS VPC
		- good for compliuance securityn
		- suppots hybrid cloud architectures, lower latency and higher bandwith compared other internet connections
	- **AWS Transit Gateway**- connect VPC and on-premise networks through central hub
- Use **Subnets** to control the traffic permissions
	- traffioc permissions will not look at the contents of the packet, just the sender to see if on the approved list
	- segment of VPC IP address range where can place groups of isolated recources
	- create a public and proivate subnet for organising resources and controlling access
- **Route Tables**- set of rules (routes) that used to determine where network traffic is directed
	- control routing of traffic within the VPC and to/from the internet and other VPCs
- subnets can pass packets of information from one another, depending if the instance of that subnet allows it
- **Network Access Control List (ACL)**- the packets that are within the message from the internet will be checked against the ACL to see if it has permission to enter or lave the network
	- Is a virtual firewall controlling inbound and outbound traffic
	- This controls the in and out for a subnet
	- stateless, so it will check every packet outgoing and inbound
	- Important to know that even if an ACL from a different subnet granted permission for it to leave that subnet, an incoming ACL doesn't automatically give it permission to enter that subnet
	- by default it allows all incoming and outgoing traffic so need to configure what it doesnt allow
-  **Security Groups**- Different instances may have different specifics about who can send them requests or recieve so need instance level network security
	- instances have security groups
	- Virtual firewall to control inbound and outband traffic to AWS resources
	- doesnt allow any traffic into the instance by default, all ports blocked and all IP addresses are blocked
	- have to configure what incoming traffic you want
	- all traffic can go out of the security group, no restrictions on outbound
	- security groups are stateful so has some memory about who to allow in or out
	- security groups by default allow all return trafiic (from the stateful memory)
	- Can have a different security group for different EC2 instances within the same subnet
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**- protects web apps from common web exploits
	- filtering and monitoring HTTp/HTTPS requests
- **Public Subnets**- 
	- resources accessible for the public like internet- APIs, client
- **Private Subnets**-
	- resoruces only to interact with through private network like adatabase through API
- Can have a public subnet talk to a pirvate subnet (API to database)
- **Domain Name System (DNS)**- 
	- request goes from the client to the Customer DNS resolver which then gets then forwards the request to the DNS server to return the IP address based on the DNS name
	- the request returned from the IP address then goes to cloudfront to connect to load balancer which sends the packet to an EC2 instance

## Storage and Databases
- **Relational Database Service (RDS)**
	- relational database are managed here (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL server etc)
	- this is the kind of outer layer which Aurora and others are managed in
	- **Lift-and-Shift**- migrate your relational database to run on an EC2 instance
		- Gives same control over the same variables like OS, memory, CPU, storage capacity
	- this includes automated patching, backups, redundancy, failover, disaster recovery managed through AWS, rather than doing yourself
	- **Aurora**- compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL and is the AWS kind of version of a relational database
- **Database Migration Service (DMS)**
	- helps customers migrate their existing database onto AWS
	- source database remains operational in the meantime while migrating to the target database on AWS
	- **Homogenous migration**- migration of the same database type- MySQL -> RDS MySQL
	- **Heterogenous migration**- migration of different database types
		- Need to convert the data with AWS Schema Conversion Tool
		- Then migrate the newly converted data
	- **Development and test database migrations** - testing against production data without impacting production users
	- D**atabase consolidation**- several databases you want to consolidate into one central database
	- **Continous database replication**- use DMS to perform continous data replication for disaster recovery or geographic separation
- **Schema Conversion Tool**-
	- converts database schema from one database engine to an other
	- generates reports to identify schema elements that require manual converting
- **EC2 Hosted Database**- full control over database environment, custom database software and specific compliance requirements. requires manual setup, maintenance, bacups and scaling
- **AWS Managed Databases**- simplified database management, automated backups, high availability, scaling and security
	- RDS, DynamioDB etc
	- less control over underlying infrastructure but signaficantly reduces operational overhead

		- managed services like RDS, Lamdba, AWS managers the underlying infrastructure, OS, patching and security configurations
	- Users control the security within the cloud
		- in charge of the OS, network and firewall configurations through the encryption key to login and create user accounts for an EC2 instance (AWS can only notify if the type of OS you are running is in-secure)
		- customer data, platforms, applications, IAM, OS, network, firewall config, client-side data encryption, server-side encryption, network trafficking protection
		- data protection through encryption and data integrity
		- in charge of IAM
		- in charge of audit logging and tracking security incidents and performance issues
