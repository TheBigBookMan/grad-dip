## Flowcharts
- drawn using shapes to show logical process of something
- **Elements**
	- **Start/Stop**- describe where process beings and ends and flowchart should only have one of each, start should have one outgoing arrow and stop has one incoming arrow (represented by round rectangles)
	- **Process elements**- describe processing step, should have one incoming arrow and one outgoing arrow- description usually starts with a verb and there can be many in flowchart (represented by rectangle)
	- **Input/output**- data enters/leaves
		- one incoming arrow and one outgoing arrow
		- stuff like user input and showing a result
		- flowcharts usually have atleast one of each
		- represented by parallelograms
	- **Decsiion element**- select one of multiple based on conditions
		- often phrased like yes/no
		- element should have one incoming arrow and multiple outgoing arrows
		- represented by diamonds
	- **Connector element**- join multiple flows and helpful for re0joining multiple different flow paths
		- should have multiple incomking arrows and one outgoing arrow
		- represented by circles
- **IDentify elements**-
	- **input/output**- when data enters te process or leaves the process
	- **decision**- looking for questions which have multiple possible outcomes
	- **process**- identified looking for 'action' steps that are not performing input or output
- **Best Design Practices**- best when designing flowchart
	- **Order**- order elements appear is essential
	- **Clear, consie, complete**- 
		- clear ha spaced out elements and minimises number of arrows crossing over each other
		- concise uses short descriptions within flowchart elements and avoids unecessary duplications
		- complete covers all possibilities the program must handle, decisions elements should include all possible outgoing arrows
	- **Top to bottom layout**- convention to flow from top to bottom so start is at top and stop s bottom
	- **KNow your arrows**- make sure the amount of arrows for each element is correct
## Python
- **Sequence**- actions executed in order
- **Selection**- condition determines which statements are executed
