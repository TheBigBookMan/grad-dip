# Chapter1 

## Data vs Information
- Data: Is the raw form of the facts gathered .
	- they don't have any meaning
	- May be many different aspects of them facts
- Information: Is the facts being represented into some meaning
	- Processing the raw data into abstract understandable words
	- May be in the form of visual graphs or tables

**Knowledge**
Data is the foundation for information which begins the aspect of knowledge about a specific subject. 
Gather data > information produced by processing data > information reveals meaning of the data > relevant and timely information key to good decisions > good decisions make good businesses

## The Databases
Databases have metadata (information about each field within the database, eg data type, not null etc) also discusses the links between fields.
Databases have the raw facts related to the relevant business logic, and the metadata provides the complete picture of importance of the raw data.

**Database Management System**
Programs that manage the database structure and controls the access to the data (MYSQL, MONGODB, POSTRGRESQL etc). DBMS allows the data to be accessed between users as well as providing the user being able to provide CRUD on the data information. The rules they are built are for how they manage the data, access to the data, basic CRUD and security.
- think of the DBMS as a program that handles your data rather than just writing it out on paper
- security, better structure and management of the data
- reduction in data inconsistency- same thing being represented multiple times differently
- Allows for easy access of data through queries (SQL)
- Better quality of data management makes better quality data

## **Database Types**
Different types determined by a different use for the databse, e.g.: how many users, where the data is located, type of data, intention for data storage or data structure.
- **User Database**
	- Single user database: only one user on the database, you will need to wait for database to free up to use- usually something like a singular database on a desktop database.
	- Multiuser database: can be used for multiple people, if around <= 50 its a workgroup database and if its a bigger amount in an organisation its a enterprise database.
- **Location Database**
	- Database at a single site is a centralized database.
	- Database across several sites is a distributed database (decentralized).
