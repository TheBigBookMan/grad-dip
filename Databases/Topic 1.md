# - Introduction to Database Technologies

## History of databases
- Databases were used in a file storage format before RDMS
- flat- file model: would always start of list and search sequentially- slowwwww
-
## Databases
- Databases are not storage but the way for a user to be able to interact with the stored data (CRUD). It also allows for structuring the data in a way that can be easier to manage and read.
- **Data redundancy** - the repetition of certain data, can lead to storage wage and inconsistency of data
- **Data integrity** -  DBMS having restraints like data types to stop certian things happening to the data.
## Databases with programming
- **Control Access**- Having security authorisation subsystem with database administrators so specific people can access the data.
- **Persistency**- Application must make sure that the data is changed across multiple sessions and is updated. Liking a post and seeing that the like is there and when you go to another oage and back that the like is still there and not reverted. Seeing the update from one page on another page where it is consistent across. Database solves this.
- **Multiple user interface** - Having different inrterfaces that are consistent to the database (same as all the apps at work).
- **Backup and recovery**- Databases provide backup when a system fdails so you can ensure the data stays the same by backing it up
