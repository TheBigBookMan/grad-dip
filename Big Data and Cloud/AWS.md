- Amazon Web Services
- digital computing in 2003
- size of digital data ever created was 4000 million GB
	- same data generated every 48 hours
- provide software and hardware remotely in order to make users life simpler
- **Software as a service**- not having to buy software and install it
	- internet transfers data through the connection
	- pay and access only the functionalities that benefit them and when they need it
- **Public cloud**- most known and used
	- made available as pay-as-you-go to general public
- **Private cloud**- large organisation to become a private cloud provider
	- create own internal data centres and dont make these centres available to public
- **Variables Combned to make computing possible**
	- experience with very large datacenters
	- unprecedented number of users enables unprecedented economis of scale
	- pervasive broadband internet
	- fast x86 visualsation
	- pay-as-you-go billing models
	- standard software stacks
- **Economies of Scale**-
	- having many users means less cost for datacenters 
	- less cost for datacenters means less cost for users
- **Four examples cloud computing**-
	- **Rapid Growth of web 2 company**- 
		- many users growing in short amount of time
		- cant run on just a desktop home computer
		- non-cloud solutions scale slowly
			- need months to setup new computers and software
			- cannot support rapid growth unless very expensive iver-provisioning
		- cloud can scale by hundreds of machines within minutes
	- **PAtterned workload/peak workload**
		- non cloud based need to provision for peak workload
			- ensure a response time
		- clous is just pay for what you use
	- **Over-provisioning and under-provisioning**
		- overprovisioning- underutilising resources 
			- over paying for wasted computational resources
		- unerprovisioning- 
			- not enough resources for demand
			- causes problems for software
	- **Elasticity**
		- ability to scale up and down computational resources based on demand
		- pay-as-you-go services work perfectl well
		- not wasting recources or money
- **Cloud-based web apps**- 
	- allows application servers to scale up and down automatically
- **Big data analytics on cloud**-
	- dont need to build data processing on site
	- can use cloud when needed
- **Types of cloud services**-
	- **Infrastructure as a service**- 
		- allows users to share physical ahrdware such as CPU and storage services
		- users can take advantage of hardware and other physical resources without capital investment
		- benefit is very few limitations on what user can confiugure service to do
		- simple sotrage service, elastic block storage, elastic compute service EC2
		- used by Virtual Machines
		- **Virtual Machines**-
			- multiple users share same computer resources
			- sharing on same computer doesnt mean resources interact, can run independently
			- Virtual Machine Manager VMM
				- hypervisor
				- creates and runs virtual machines
				- provides interfact identical to the host (except in the case of paravirtualisation)
				- usually guest is an OS
				- configure resources available to each gues OS- ege 2 virtual CPUs of RAM/ GB on disk
			- Protection due to isolation
				- host systems protected against virus, security breaches and bugs in gues OS systems
				- one OS system is protected from another guest OS
			- Flexibility-
				- suspend and resume virtual machine
				- snapshot of virtual machine state
					- can be used allow to restoring previous state
					- VM can be cloned
			- Consolidation of resources-
				- many lightly use systems combined create heavily used system
			- cheaper to manage
				- 100 physica lservers running 20 virtual = 2000 virtual servers
			- live migration
				- moves a running gues from on physical machine to another
				- useful when system is overloaded for load balancing
				- useful when hardware upgraded or repaired
			- install software conf on virtual machine image
				- redoployment of OS and environment much faster
	- **Platform as a service**-
		- allow tenats share the OS and application frameworks
		- allows sharing database service admin which cuts costs significantly and more efficient than virtual machines
		- higher level of service at a lower cost for users
		- relational database services, dynamo DB, Route 55, elastic mapreduce
	- **Software as a service**-
		- services directly consumable by end user allowing to share entire software stack
		- gmail, google calendar, google docs, dropbox

## Amazon Web Services
- amazon found christmas period had too high demand for their hardware
- **SErvices**-
	- **Deployment & Management**
		- **AWS Management console**- web interface
		- **Deployment & Automation**-
			- AWS Cloudformation
			- Elastic Beanstalk
			- OpsWorks
		- **Monitoring**- Cloudwatch
		- **Identity & Access**- IAM
	- **Application services and networking**-
		- **Content delivery**- cloudfront
		- **Distributed computing**
			- amazon EWR
			- auto scaling
		- **Networking**
			- AMazon VPC
			- Route 53
			- Elastic load balancing
			- AWS direct connect
	- **Compute, storage and database**
		- **Compute**- EC2
		- **Storage**
			- S3
			- glacier
			- EBS
		- **Database**
			- redshift
			- dynamodb
			- amazon rds
			- elastiache
- **Regions**- usually different cities
	- consists of data centers within a region
	- **Availability Zones**- where data centers reside
	- each region has multiple AZ (mainly minimum 2)
	- each AZ has separate power provider enabling other data centers to continue to operate when single power provider goes down
	- increase fault tolerance during natural disasters
	- allow users to spread computation across multiple tier 1 ISPs
- **Edge Location**- help lower latency and improve perfoamcen by caching data closer to user
- **Security**
	- **Security groups**- built-in firewall for virtual servers
		- associate multiple security groups with an instance
		- all other internet ports blocked by default
		- **Web Tier**- accept traffic port 80/443 from anywhere on internet
		- **App Tier**- accept traffic from web tier
			- SSH to app tier- acts as bastion
		- **DB Tier**- only accept traffic from app tier
			- authoriused 3rd parties granted SSH access
		- additional rules to allow remote administration via SSH
	- **Virtual Private Cloud VPC**-
		- provision a logically isolated section of AWS cloud to launch AWS services in a virtual network that you define
		- complete control over your virtual networking environment
			- own IP address
			- createion of subnets
			- configuration of route tables and network gateways
- **AWS Storage Services**-
	- **Simple Storage Service (S3)**-
		- designed to store objects
		- write once and read many times
		- good for fles that dont need to be updated- like images
		- designed for 99.999999999% durability and availability of objects over a given year
		- highly scalable, reliable and inexpensive
		- need to upload a file to store in a bucket, set permissions and add metadata
		- limit 100 buckets per account
		- choose geographical region where S3 buckets and contents stored
		- bandwith into S3 is free but AWS charge rate on bandwith out
		- space is provided in a prorated GB per month and can be calculated
	- **Elastic Block Storage (EBS)**-
		- read and write raw bytes like normal disk drive
		- store data via file system
		-
