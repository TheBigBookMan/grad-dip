- Amazon Web Services
- digital computing in 2003
- size of digital data ever created was 4000 million GB
	- same data generated every 48 hours
- provide software and hardware remotely in order to make users life simpler
- **Software as a service**- not having to buy software and install it
	- internet transfers data through the connection
	- pay and access only the functionalities that benefit them and when they need it
- **Public cloud**- most known and used
	- made available as pay-as-you-go to general public
- **Private cloud**- large organisation to become a private cloud provider
	- create own internal data centres and dont make these centres available to public
- **Variables Combned to make computing possible**
	- experience with very large datacenters
	- unprecedented number of users enables unprecedented economis of scale
	- pervasive broadband internet
	- fast x86 visualsation
	- pay-as-you-go billing models
	- standard software stacks
- **Economies of Scale**-
	- having many users means less cost for datacenters 
	- less cost for datacenters means less cost for users
- **Four examples cloud computing**-
	- **Rapid Growth of web 2 company**- 
		- many users growing in short amount of time
		- cant run on just a desktop home computer
		- non-cloud solutions scale slowly
			- need months to setup new computers and software
			- cannot support rapid growth unless very expensive iver-provisioning
		- cloud can scale by hundreds of machines within minutes
	- **PAtterned workload/peak workload**
		- non cloud based need to provision for peak workload
			- ensure a response time
		- clous is just pay for what you use
	- **Over-provisioning and under-provisioning**
		- overprovisioning- underutilising resources 
			- over paying for wasted computational resources
		- unerprovisioning- 
			- not enough resources for demand
			- causes problems for software
	- **Elasticity**
		- ability to scale up and down computational resources based on demand
		- pay-as-you-go services work perfectl well
		- not wasting recources or money
- **Cloud-based web apps**- 
	- allows application servers to scale up and down automatically
- **Big data analytics on cloud**-
	- dont need to build data processing on site
	- can use cloud when needed
- **Types of cloud services**-
	- **Infrastructure as a service**- 
		- allows users to share physical ahrdware such as CPU and storage services
		- users can take advantage of hardware and other physical resources without capital investment
		- benefit is very few limitations on what user can confiugure service to do
		- simple sotrage service, elastic block storage, elastic compute service EC2
		- used by Virtual Machines
		- **Virtual Machines**-
			- multiple users share same computer resources
			- sharing on same computer doesnt mean resources interact, can run independently
			- Virtual Machine Manager VMM
				- hypervisor
				- creates and runs virtual machines
				- provides interfact identical to the host (except in the case of paravirtualisation)
				- usually guest is an OS
				- configure resources available to each gues OS- ege 2 virtual CPUs of RAM/ GB on disk
			- Protection due to isolation
				- host systems protected against virus, security breaches and bugs in gues OS systems
				- one OS system is protected from another guest OS
			- Flexibility-
				- suspend and resume virtual machine
				- snapshot of virtual machine state
					- can be used allow to restoring previous state
					- VM can be cloned
			- Consolidation of resources-
				- many lightly use systems combined create heavily used system
			- cheaper to manage
				- 100 physica lservers running 20 virtual = 2000 virtual servers
			- live migration
				- moves a running gues from on physical machine to another
				- useful when system is overloaded for load balancing
				- useful when hardware upgraded or repaired
			- install software conf on virtual machine image
				- redoployment of OS and environment much faster
	- **Platform as a service**-
		- allow tenats share the OS and application frameworks
		- allows sharing database service admin which cuts costs significantly and more efficient than virtual machines
		- higher level of service at a lower cost for users
		- relational database services, dynamo DB, Route 55, elastic mapreduce
	- **Software as a service**-
		- services directly consumable by end user allowing to share entire software stack
		- gmail, google calendar, google docs, dropbox
