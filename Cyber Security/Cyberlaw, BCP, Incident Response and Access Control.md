- **Laws**- exist to protect against computer crime
	- **Criminal Law**- outlines the rules and sanctions for major violations of the public trust
		- computer fraud and abuse act (1986)
		- electronic communications privacy act (1986)
		- digital millenium copyright act (1986)
	- **Civil Law**- provides us with aframework for conducting business
		- trademark law
		- patent law
	- **Administrative Law**- government agencies use administrative law to promulgate the day-to-day regulations that interpret existing law. many government agencies promulgate administrative law
		- HIPAA securty rule (2003) which affects specific types of industries and data types
- Most laws related to IT securtiy fall into civil and administrative law
- Cases for information theft, system intrusions, identity theft and other crimes that are harmful to coeity and may trigger criminal sanctions
- **Main Laws Applicable in Aus**
	- **Privacy Act (1988)**
		- key piece legilsation in Australia that protects handling of personal information in the online space
		- defines personal information as any information or opinion that could be used to identify an individual, regardless of whether its true or recorded in a metrial form
		- applies to mainly government agencies and private sector organiasationg with annual turnover of more than 3 million dollars
	- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
		- European Union law that requires organisations to protect personal data
		- biled as the toughes privacy and security law in the world when put into effect 2018
		- it applies to organisations anywhere that process personal data of EU residents
	- **Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act (CLOUD Act)**
		- US federal law enacted 2018 to updated Stored Communications Act (SCA) of 1986 
		- protects privacy of contents of files stored by service providers and of records held about the subscriber by service providers
		- addresses challenges the FBI faced in obtatining data from service providers using SCA warrants as original SCA was created before advent of cloud computing
		- CLOUD Act enables federal law enforcement with a warrant or subpoena to compel a US-based technology company to provide data stored on their servers, regardless of whether the data is located in US or abroad.
		- Aus signed the Australia-US CLOUD Act agreement so authoirites in both countries can more readily obtain electornic data stroed in each others countries
	- **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) (1986)**
		- US criminal law that makes federal offence to engage in many types of hacking activity
		- specifically CFAA prohibits unauthorised access to any computer system that is engaged in interstate commerse
		- prohibits the creation of malcious code that might cause damage to computer system
		- many nuances to this law, bottom line is making hacking criminal offencse
	- **Identify Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act (ITADA) (1988) **
		- US law that makes it federal crime to steal an individuals identity including using or possessing false identification and transferring or using identity information without consent with the intent of committing fraud
		- some rules apply to specific industries such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act for health care, payment card industry and publicly traded company industrey
	- **Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) (1986)**
		- US law restriucts government interception of communications and stored information
		- includes telephone calls, network transmissions, email messages and pen registers that log records of communications
		- government mmust meet stringet requirements before receiving a search warrant for electornic communcaitions
- **Compliance**-
	- information security professional should be aware of compliance requirements specific to industry and business activities
	- financial organisations may have auditors conduct IT controls and audit designed to ensure information security controls are sufficient to ensure compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002)
	- Payment card industry may need organisation to retain approved independent auditors to verify controls and provide a report directly to the regulators
- **Intellectual Property**-
	- Intangible assets are collectively referred to as intellectual property
	- **Copyright**-
		- copyright law guarantees the creators of 'original works of authorship' protection against the unauthorised duplication of their work
		- 'original works' include: literary works, musical works, dramatic works, pantomimes and choreographic works, pictorial, graphical, sculptural works, motion pictures, audiovisual works, sound recordings and architectural wors
	- **Trademarks**-
		- there are the words, slogans and logos used to identify a company and its products or services
	- **Patents**-
		- protect intellectual property rights of inventors
		- three main requirements
			- invention must be new, inventions are patentable only if they are original ideas
			- invention must be useful, must actually work and accomplish some sort of task
			- invention must not be obvious, you cant make a patent for something dumb
	- **Trade Secrets**-
		- many companies have intellectual property that is absolutely critical to their business and signifcant damage would result if were disclosed to competitors or the public
		- to preseerve trade secre status, must implement adequate controls within your organisation to ensure only authorised personall with a need to know of the secrets have acces to them
		- must also ensure anyone who does hav ethis type of acces is bound by NDA that prohibis them from sharing information with others and provides penalties for violating the agreement
		- trade secret protection is on the best ways to protect computer software
- **Software as Intellectual Property**-
	- software is a form of intellectual property
	- companies invest resources in developing it and proretcing it theough license agreements
	- **License agreements**- include the terms of use for software that an organisatio nacquire and use and can contain many different provisions that cover the circumstances of acceptable use
		- number and trypes of individuals who may use the software
		- amount of information that may be processed
		- locations where data may be processed
		- number of servers supporting the software
		- other restrictions the software publisher chooses to use
	- some sofware license agreements come in different forms
		- **Detailed Contracts**
			- some cases, software agreements are details contracts that are negotiated between software endor and the customer
			- epecially true in case of expensive enterprise software
			- in these cases the vendor often proposes a license agreement and then the customer suggests revisions
			- there may be many rounds of negotiation before two sides agree on mutually acceptable lanague
		- **Click-through Agreements**-
			- other end of the spectrum
			- take-it or leave-it agreements where customer simply clisk 'I agree' button as they purchase software or gisn up for a service
			- these agreemetns can be dangerous because users typically dont read them and they may be comitting their organisation to underisrable restricitons
		- **Shrink-wrap Agreements**-
			- these same as click-through agreements but they are included on physical package of a piece of software and they take effect when user breaks the seal on the package
			- shrink wrap agreements rarely used today simple because most software distrubute online and not hardware

## Business Continuity Planning (BCP)
- involves assessing risks to organisational processe to create policies, plans and procedures to minimse the effect those risks might hav eon organisation
- organisations reliant on technology should have a robust business continuity plan to remain operational during emergencies
- BCP is key responsibility of cybersecurity professional, but cross functional team should assess both quantitative and qualitative risks identifying measures to mitigate impacts and restore normal operations quickly
- Process involves
	- project scope and planning
	- business impact assessment
	- continuity planning
	- approval and implementation
- must include documentation, covering continuity guidelines, risk management strategies and emergency respose protocols. should also outline priorities, responsibilites and timelines ensuring the plan is clear for  both current and future team members

## Incident Response
- when a security incident does occur, and organisation must be able to respond appropriately to limit or contain the incident and minmise impoact on the organisation
- CISSP security operations domain recommends following steps for manageing incident response
	1. **Detection**
		- identify and confirm hat security incident is occurring or has occurred
		- involves monitoring systems, logs, intrusion detection systems, antivurs alerts, user reports and other threat intelligence sources
		- key signs include unusual traffic patterns, unaithorised access attemtps or alerts from monitoring tools
		- early and accurate detection is crucial to reduce impact
		- example- a firewall flags a large volume of outbound traffic to a suspicious IP- indicating data exfiltration attempt
	2. **Response**
		- immediately act to contain and understand the scope of an incident
		- notify internal incident response team
		- perform initial assessment to understand how widespread and severe the incident is
		- prioritise based on impact- is this a ransomware attack or a phishing email
		- example- security team isolates affected systems from the network to repvent lateral movement
	3. **Mitigation**
		- limit the damate and stop the attacks progression
		- block malicious IP addresses or domains
		- disable compromised accounts
		- shut down affected servers or applications
		- remove malware or corrupted files if possible
		- example- compromised user account is disabled, and access logs are viewed to idetnfiy further unauthorised activity
	4. **Reporting**
		- communicate what has happened internally and externally if required
		- internal- notify senior managementm, legal teams and affected departments
		- external- report to regulatory bodies, customers, partners or law enforcementt, as needed especially for breaches involving personal data
		- example- data breach involving customer PII may require notification under GD
	5. **Recovery**
		- restore systems, services and oeprations to a secure and normal state
		- restore systems from clean backups
		- verify systems are patched and hardedned before bringing them back online
		- monitor for signs of reinfection or residual threats
		- example- reinstalling the operating system and restoring clean backups on a ninfected server, followed by intensive monitoring
	6. **Remediation**
		- fix the root cause and roevent recurrence
		- apply patches and updates
		- harden systems- disable unnecessary ports/services and improve firewall rules
		- improve user training, update antivirus definitions and ehance monitoring
		- example- if breach came from an unpatched CMS plugin, the fix might include updating or replacing the plugin and implementing stricter update policies
	7. **Lessons Learned**
		- analyse the incident to improve processes and reduce future risk
		- conduct a post-incident review
		- identify gaps in detection ,response or prevention
		- update incident response plans and train staff based on findingns
		- example- the team finds an outdated alert threshold delayted detection, they adjust thresholds and train staff on earlier warning signs
- detection initiates te process and incidents are confirmed before moving to containment and response while preserving evidence. recovery ensures systems are restored securely, and remediation and root cause analysis aim to prevent future incidents
- **Incident Prevention**
	- prevention is preferable over responding to an attack after it has already happened
	- practices like regular patching, disabling unused services and employing intrusion detection and prevention systems help defend against attacks
	- Intrusion Detection SYstems (IDS) use knowledge based (signature based) or behaviour based methods to identify threats, with passive systems logging events and active ones blocking attacks
	- host-based IDS monitor individual devides, while network based IDS monitor overall network activitity
	- to divery attackers from production entowrks, honeypots and similar tools can be used
	- anti-malware at network boundaries, on servers and on endpoints is essential and user education reduces risk from social engineering attacks
	- are other means to prevent or monitor malicious activitiy
	- penetration testing with proper authorisation, tests system defences by simulating attacks using varying levels of internal knowledge
	- audits and monitoring ensure accountability by logging system actitivies, which serve as forensic evidence and help reconstruct events for accountability
	- sampling and clipping levels aid in managing large files
	- security audits, access reviews and entitlement audits verify complians with security policies and support the principle of least privilege.
	- audit reports should be protected and limited to specific personalle to prevent attackers from exploiting discolosed vulnerabilities

## Access Control
- refers the ability to allow system or resource access only to authorused users, programs or processes
- granting or denying access occurs according to a specified security model that bestows certain permissions to access a resource
- access control comprises an entire set of procedures performae dby hardware, software and administrators to monitor access, idetnfiy users requesting access, record access attempts and grant or deny access based on pre-established rules
- **Types of access control**-
	- **Physical Controls**-
		- access controls are items you can physucally touch and are designed to prevent, monitor or detect direct contact with systems or areas withi na facility
		- examples- guards, fences, motion detectors, locked doors, sealed windows, lights, cable protection, laptop locks, badges, swipe cards, guard dogs, video cameras alarms etc
	- **Logical/Technical Controls**-
		- technological hardware or software mechanisms used to manage access to and provide protection for resources and systems
		- examples- authentication methods (passwords, smartcards, biometrics), encryption, constrained interfaces, access control lists, protocols, firewalls, routes, intrusion detection systems and clipping levels
	- **Administrative Controls**-
		- policies and procedures defined by an organisations security policy and other regulations or requirements
		- categorised by how they are implemented- can be implemented administratively, logically/technically or physically
		- sometimes referred to as management controls
		- focus on personnnel and business practices
		- examples- policies, procedures, hiring practices, background checks, classifying and labelling data, security awareness and training efforts, reports and reviews, personnel controls and testing
- **Five types of access control strategies**
	- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**- based on the role of the subject
		- access to resources is granted base don the role the user holds
		- roles are assigned permission, and users are assigned roles, users dont get permissions directly
		- centralised control over permissions
		- supports **least privilege** principle- users only get access necessary for their job
		- easier to manage access a group ratehr than just users
		- example- software engineer can access code repository but not HR database
	- **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**- grants or restricts object access and is determined by the objects owner
		- owner of a file or resource has the discretion to grant access to others
		- access control lists ACL or capability tables are common mechanisms
		- more flexible but less secure, as users can grant access for other users- can lead to privilege sprawl
		- common in windows/linux systems with file-level permissions
		- example- alice creates a document and grants access to Bob but not Carol even though same role
	- **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**- restricts the actions that a subject can perform on an object
		- the system, not owner controls access based on securirty labels or classifications
		- users and data are both assigned security levels (eg top secret, confidential, unclassified)
		- very strict- users cannot override permissions
		- common in government and military
		- example- document labeled 'top secret' cannot be accessed by a user with 'secret' clearance even if they own the file
	- **Permission-based Access Control (or rule-based Access Control)**- is the abstraction of application actions into a set of permissions
		- access is granted based on rules that evaluate conditions like time of dayt, location or system state
		- rules can be static or dynamic
		- often used in firewalls, routers and systems with contextual policies
		- useful for enforcing business logic (eg no access after 6pm)
		- example- rule may state "only allow VPN during business hours"
	- **Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC)**- abstraction of application actions into a set of rules and attributed defining the characteristics of those rules
		- makes decisions based on a set of attributes
			- **Subject Attributes**- users department, clearance level, role
			- **Object Atttributes**- file, type, classification
			- **Environmental Attributes**- time, location, device type
		- very fine grained and flexible
		- often used in modern, cloud-based systems
		- policies are written as logic rules using attributes
- **Security Models**-
	- several access control security mofels that illustrate access control implementations and cam help organisationa quickly make improvements through adaptation
	- they can be used to enforce security policy (rules of system config) and for assessing the effictiveness of computer security controls into a computer system
	- **Bell- LaPadula Confidentiality Model**-
		- is a 'state machine' reference model, meaning it uses a formal mathematical model to describe the systems states and transitions
		- employs the 'no read up, no write down' principle which ensures users cannot read data at a higher security level that then own and cannoy write data to a lower security level
		- model implements both mandatory access control MAC and discetionary access control DAC providing robust framework for managing access permissions based on both system enforced rules and user defined policies
		- ![[Pasted image 20250605162600.png]]
	- **Biba Integrity Model**-
		- focused on maintaining data integrity by preventing unauthorised modifications, it ensures data remains accurate and reliable by enforcing strict access controls
		- prevent corruption of higher integrity entities
		- prevent data modification by unauthorised parties
		- prevent unauthorised data modification by authorised parties
		- maintain internal and external consistency
		- based on the 'no write up, no read down' principle
		- ![[Pasted image 20250605162723.png]]
	- **Clark-Wilson Integrity Model**-
		- designed to ensure data integrity by enforcing weel-formed transactions and seaparation of duties
		- focuses on preventing unauthorised users from making changes and ensuring that authorised users onloy make authorised changes
		- no changes by unauthorised subjects
		- no unauthorised changes by authorised subjects
		- maintenance of internal and external consistency
	- **Graham-Denning Access Control Model**-
		- provides a framework for defining how subjsects (users) and objects (resources) interact withi na system
		- outlines the rules for securely creating and deleting subjects and objects as well as assigning specific access rights
		- composed of a set of objects, set of subjects and set of rights
		- shows how subjects and objects should be securely created and delted
		- addresses how to assign specific access rights
		- mainly used in access control mechanisms for distributed systems
