- Risk management is process of identifyinf risks (vulnerabilities) to n orgnisations information assets and infrastructure and taking steps to reduce these risks to acceptable level
- can also be descirbed as process of identifying, assessing and controlling risks facing an organisation
- **Components of Risk Management**-
	- **Risk Identification**- process of examination and documentation of the security posture of organisations information tech and risks it face. includes recognition, enumeration and documentation of risks to an organisations information assets
		1. **Plan & organise process**
			- being by organising a team, consisting of representatives of all affected groups
		2. **Identify, inventory & categorise assets**-
			- asset identification and valuation is an iterative process, beginning with identification of assets
			- includes all element of organisations sytem- people, procedures, data, information, software, hardware and entworking
			- classify and categorise assets by adding details as dif deeper into analysis
			- Traditional System Components -> SecSDLC Components -> Risk management system components
				- **People**-
					- **Employees**-
						- Trusted employee
						- other staff
					- **Non-employees**-
						- people at trusted organisations
						- strangers
				- **Procedures**-
					- **Procedures**-
						- IT and standard business procedures
						- IT and business-sensitive procedures
				- **Data**-
					- **Information**-
						- transmission
						- processing
						- storage
				- **Software**-
					- **Software**-
						- application
						- operating system
						- security components
				- **Hardware**-
					- **System devices and peripherals**
						- systems and peripherals
						- security devices
					- **Networking components**-
						- intranet components
						- internet or DMZ components
			- Process of identifying and valuing these assets in more detail
				- **People, procedures and data asset identification**-
					- not as readily discovered and documented
					- assets should be identified, described and evaluated by people using knowledge, experience and judgement
					- also be recorded in a reliable data-handling process:
						- **Asset attributed for people**- position name/number/ID, supervisor, security clearance level, special skills
						- **Asset attributes for procedures**- description, intended purpose, what elements it is tied to, storage location for reference, storage location for update
						- **Asset attributes for data**- classification, owner/creator/manager, data structure size, data structure used, online/offline status. location, backup procedures employed
				- **Hardware, software and network asset identification**-
					- automated tools can uncover system elements that comprise the hardware, software and network components
					- information attributes to track depends on
						- needs of the organisation/risk management efforts
						- management needs of information security/information technology communities
						- asset attributes to be considered are name, IP address, MAC address, element type, serial number, manufacturer name, model/part number, software version, physical or logical location and controlling entity
		3. **Classify, Value & Prioritise Assets**-
			- examples-
				- confidential data, internal data, public data. information organisations generally organise themselves to create a useable data classification model
				- government agenciesm y have unclassified, sensitive bu unclassified (SBU), confidential, secret, or top secret categories
				- there can be other classifications, such as need-to-know and named projects (list of personnel having access to those projects)
			- other side of data classification scheme is personnel security clearance structure, identifying the level of information each individual is authorised to bview based on their need-to-know
			- Each organisation should create a weighting for each category based on answers to previous questions
			- considerations for calculations
				- **Value retained from the cost of creatng the information asset**- 
					- information is created or acquired at some cost to the organisation
					- cost can be calculated or estimated
				- **Value retained from past meintenance of the information asset**-
					- estimated that for every dollar spent developing an application or acquiring and processing data, many more are spent on maintencce over the useful life of data or software
					- cists can be estimated by quantifying human resources used to continially update, support, modify, and service applications and systems associated with particular information asset
				- **Value implied by cost of replacing information**-
					- includes human resource time needed to reconstruct, restore, or regenerate the information from backups, independent transaction logs, hard copies of data sources
					- restoration can sometimes take longer than it took to create the data
				- **Value from providing information**-
					- different come cost of developing or maintaining information is cost of providing information to users who need it
					- includes value associated with the delivery of information via databases, networks, hardware and software systems
					- also includes cost of infrastructure necessary to provide access and control of information
				- **Value incurred from cost of protecting information**-
					- value of an asset is based in part on cost of protecting it, while amount of money spend to protect an asset is based in part on value of the asset
				- **Value to owners**-
					- values listed prebiously are easy to calculate, this and following values are mote like to be esimates of costs
					- value to owners- howmuch is your social security number worth to you? telelhone number?
					- very subjective measurements
			- **Weighted Factor Analysis**-
				- once inventory and value assessment is complete, can prioritise each asset using straightforward process
				- each information asset is assigned a score for each of a set of assigned critical factors
				- scores range from 0.1 to 1.0 - range recommended by NIST SP800-30 Risk Management for Information Technology Systems and then each critical factor is assigned a weight (1 to 100) to indicate importance for organisation![[Pasted image 20250509151109.png]]
				- ![[Pasted image 20250509151119.png]]
				- 
				
		4. **Identify and Prioritise Threats**-
			- each of these identified threats has potential to attack any protected assets
			- to make process manageable, each step in threat identification ad vulnerability identification process is managed separately and then coordinated at end of process
			- realistic threats need investigation, while unimportant threats are set aside, threat assessment can include asking-
				- which threats present danger to assets?
				- which threats represent most danger to the information?
				- how much would it cost to recover from an attack?
				- which threat requires the greates expenditure to prevent?
			- **Common Threats to information security**- Threat -> Example
				- **Act of human error or failure** - accidents, employee mistakes
				- **Compromises to intellectual property**- piracy, copyright infringement
				- **Deliberate acts of espionage or trespass**- unauthorised access and data collection
				- **Deliberate acts of information extortion**- blackmail for information disclosure
				- **Deliberate acts of sabotage or vandalism**- destruction of system or information
				- **Deliberate acts of theft**- illegal confiscation of equipment or information
				- **Deliberate software attacks**- viruses, worms, macros, denial of service
				- **Forces of nature**- fire, flood, earthquake, lightning
				- **Quality of service deviations from service providers**- power and WAN quality of service issues
				- **Technical hardware failures or errors**- equipment failure
				- **Technical software failures or errors**- bugs, code problems, unknown loopholes
				- **Technological obsolescence**- antiquared or outdated technologies
		5. **Specify Asset Vulnerabilities**-
			- reviewing each information asset for each threat it faces and creating list of vulnerabilities that remain viable risks to organisation
			- vulnerabilities are specific avenues that threat agends can exploit to attack an information asset
			- end of risk identification process, should have a prioritised list of assets and their vulnerabilities. list servers as starting point for next step in risk management process- risk assessment
			- list priorities list threats facing organising based on thweight table discussed- two lists can be combined into a **threates-nvulnerablities- assets (TVA)** worksheet for addition of vulnerability and control information during risk assessment
			- **Vulnerability Assessment (on a router)**
				- **Compromises to intellectual property**-
					- copyrighted works developed in house and stored on intranet servers can be copied without perfmission unless the router is configured to limit access from outsiders
					- works copyrighted by others can be stolen; your organisation is liable for that loss to copyright holder
				- **Espionage or trespass**-
					- information asset (router) may have little intrinsic value, but other assets protected by this device could be attacked if it does not perform correctly or is compromised
				- **FOrces of nature**-
					- all information assets in organisation are subject to forces unless suitable controls ar eprovided
				- **Human error of failure**-
					- employees or contractors may cause an outage if configuration errors are made
				- **Information extortion**-
					- if attackers bypass the router or compromise it and then enter your network, may encrypt your data in place, may not have stolen it but unless pay them to acquire encruption key the data is inert and of no value
				- **Deviation in quality of service**-
					- power system failures are always possible, unless suitable electrical power conditiongin isprovided
					- ISP connectivity failures can interrupt internet bandwidth
					- ![[Pasted image 20250509161904.png]]
	- **Risk Assessment**- determination of the extent to which organisations information assets are exposed or at risk and assigna risk rating to each specific information asset
		- **Determine Loss Frequency (likelihood)**-
			- asset identification and valuation
				- Risk = likelihood of vulnerability occurence x value (or impact)
				- subtract percentage risk already controlled
				- add element of uncertainty
			- loss frequency is calculated- loss frequency = likelihood x probability of success
		- **Evaluate loss magnitude (impact)**-
			- other side of data classification scheme is personnel security clearance structure, identifying level of information each individual is authorised to view on based on their need-to-know
			- loss magnitude = value of asset x percentage of loss
			- risk determination, loss magnitude is determined by considering both the asset value and the probable loss from a successful attack
		- **Calculate Risk**- 
			- each identified threat has potential to attack any assets protected
			- ![[Pasted image 20250509164959.png]]
		
		- **Assess Risk Acceptability**-
			- results of risk assessment are presented in the ranked vulnerability risk worksheet, summarises asset, asset relative value, vulnerability, loss frequency and lss magnitude
	- **Summary of risk identification and assesmsent**-
		- **Information asset clasfficiation worksheet**- assembles information about information assets and their value to the organisation
		- **Weighted criteria analaysis worksheet**- assigns a ranked value or impact weight to each information asset
		- **Ranked vulnerability risk worksheet**- assigns a ranked value or risk rating for each uncontrolled asset- vulnerability pair
	- **Risk Control**- application of measures to reduce the risks to organisations data and information systems. involves implementing security controls that reduce the risks to information assets to acceptable level
		- select control strategies
		- justify controls
		- implement, monitor and assess controls
		- need to identify the possible steps to decrease likelihood of risk scenario- controls need to be identified to mitigate risk
		- for each threat and associated vulnerabilities that have any risk, create prelimenary list of control ideas, justify the cost and implement them
		- **Residual Risk**- find the risks and control them to make more manageable and reduce number of risks
		- **Key risk control strategies**- when managing risks within organistion, there are 5 primary strategies to address or control
		- ![[Pasted image 20250512083058.png]]
			- **Defence**- prevent the exploitation of vulnerabilities, accomplished though countering threats, removing asset vulnerabilities, limiting asset access and adding protective safeguards
				- application of policy
				- education and training
				- applying technology
			- **Mitigation**- reduce the impact of an attack rather than reduce the success of the atack itself. solid in place policies can help mitigate the impact
				- **Incident Response (IR) plan**- defines the actions to take while the indicent is in progress
				- **Disaster Recovery (DR) plan**- most common mitigation procedurel involves preparations for the recovery process
				- **Business Continuity (BC) plan**- encompasses the continuation of business activities if a catastrophic event occurs
			- **Transference**- shift risk to other assets, processes or organisations. if lacking, organisation should hire individuals or firms that provide security management and admin expertise. organisation may then transfer the risk associated with management of complex systems to another organisation experienced dealing with those risks
			- **Acceptance**- involves doing nothing to protect a vulnerability and accepting the outcome of exploitation. approach only valid when particular function, service, information or asset does not justify cost of protection
			- **Termination**- directs organisation to avoid business activities that introduce uncontrollable risks. organisation may seek an alternative mechanism to meet customers needs
		- **Justifying Controls**- asset valuation involves estimating real/perceived costs associated with design, development, installation, maintenance, protection, recovery and defence against loss/litigation. process results in an estimate of potential loss per risk. Question to be asked here:
			- what damage could occur, and what financial impact would it have?
			- what would it cost to recover from the attack, in addition to the financial impact of damage?
			- what is the single loss expectancy for each risk?
		- **Cost Benefit Analysis**- 
			- determines where or not particular control is worth its cost
			- ![[Pasted image 20250512085550.png]]
		- **Control Cycle**- selection and implementation of a control strategy is not end of a process; strategy and its accompanying controls must be monitored and re-evaluated on an ongoing basis to determine their effectiveness and to calculate the estimated residual risk more accruately
			- how the cyclical process ensures risks are cointrolled- there is no exit from this cycle, it is a process that continues for as long as the organisation continues to function
			- ![[Pasted image 20250512085745.png]]
	- **Desirable Risk Level**- 
		- not all risks can be mitigated or avoided
		- organisation must define the level of risk willing to live with
		- requires trade offs between perfect security and unlimited accessibility
		- determine how many resources, byudgets, attention and anything goes to security (eg banks want a lot of resources to security)
	- **Risk Management Framework**- effectively manage risks in an organisation, several established frameworks and processess guide implementation of security controls and risk mitigation strategies.
		- **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)**- describes risk management as comprehensive process require organisings to frame risk, assess risk, respond to determined risk and monitor risk on ongoing basis
		- ![[Pasted image 20250512090128.png]]
		- **ISO 27005 Risk Management Process**- desvirbes risk management as continous iteractive process. steps consist of context establishment, risk assessment, risk treatment, risk acceptance, monitoring and communication. steps are performed iteratively and continuously to keep risk management system up to date
			- **Context Establishment**- initial step where organisation defines scope of risk management process. involves identifying environment in which risks will be assessed, including assets at risk, threats and vulnerabilities within organisation
			- **Risk Assessment**- stage involves assessing risks that may affect organisations information security, risk assessment continous process and is subdivided into three parts
				- **Risk Identification**- identifying potential threats that could harm the organisations information assets
				- **Risk Analysis**- evaluating the likelihood and potential impact of these threats
				- **Risk Evalucation**- comparing estimated risks against risk criteria to determine their significance and prioritise them for treatment
			- **Risk Decision Point  1 (Assessment Satisfactory)**- after risk assessment, decicion point is reached. if the assessment is deemed satisfactory then the process moves forward, if not it loops back for further refinement
			- **Risk Treatment**- involves deciding on the best course of action for managing risks, it may include risk mitigation strategies such as implementating additional security controls or transferring risks to another party through mechanisms like insurance
			- **Risk Decision Point 2 (Treatment Satisfactory)**- once risks hav ebeen treated, there is second decision point. if treatments are deemed satsifactory, process can proceed, if not additional treatments may need to be implemented
			- **Risk Acceptance**- if risk treatment is deemed satsifactory, organisation formally accepts the remaining risk. this implies residual risks are within acceptable limits based on organisations risk appetite
			- **Risk Communication and Consultation**- throughout process, effective communication with stakeholders is critical. ensuring stakeholders understand the risks and treatments is essential for successful implementation and monitoring
			- **Risk Monitoring and Review**- continuous monitoring and review are crucial to ensure that risks are managed effectively over time. step also involves checking risk treatments are effective and that risk environment has not changed significantly
			- **End of First or Subsequent Iteration**- process is iterative, meaning tha tit repeats to ensure ongoing risk management as new threats emerge or risk landscape changes
## CORAS
- **CORAS Process**- 
	- process for security risk analaysis, it is a graphucal language that supports analysis process ad is basis for communication, documentation and analysis
	- risk management process is based on ISO 31000: Risk Manangement- principles and guielines
	- ![[Pasted image 20250512093337.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20250512093345.png]]
	- **Risk Management Process Steps**- Five key steps in risk management process
		1. **Identify Context**- begin risk management process, essential to identify the context in which analysis will take place
			- **Characterise the target of analysis**- clearly define the focus and scope of analysis to ensure all relevant aspects are considered
			- **Identify and value assets**- conduct an asset-driven risk analysis process, focusing on business-oriented aspects such as availability of services that generate revue
			- **Specify risk evaluation criteria**- determine acceptable level of risk by identifying what losses the client can tolerate, similar to setting requirements in system development
		2. **Identify Risks**- next step involves identifying potential risks to the assets
			- **Identify threats to assets through structured brainstorming**- use methods like Hazard and Operability Analysis (HazOp) and involve diverse group of participants, including system owners, users, developers, domain experts and risk analysis experts (5-7 people)
			- **Identify vulnerabilities of assets**- utilise questionnaires and checklists to systematically identify weaknesses in assets
			- **Equipment physical secuity**
				- ensure that equipment is properly physically protected against unauthorised access to data or loss of data
				- verify that power supplies are managed in a way that prevents data loss and ensures availability
		3. **Analyse Risk Level**- after identifying risks, important to analyse their severity
			- recognise that it is impossible to completely eliminate all risks
			- determine which risks require treatment by assessing their seriousness and prioritising them accordingly
		4. **Evaluate Risks**- evaluating risks involves analysing likelihood and consequences of unwanted incidents
			- **Quantitative values**- assign numberical values to risks, such as potential losso f $1mill with a 25% change per year
			- **Qualitative values**- use descriptive terms like high, medium, and low to categorise risks
		5. **Treat Risks**- final step is to address identified risks
			- **Identify treatments for unaccpeted risks**- develop strategies to mitigate or manage risks that are deemed unacceptable
			- **Evaluate and prioritise different treatments**- assess the effectiveness of various risk treatments and prioritise them based on their potential impact and feasibility
	- **Model-based Risk Analysis**-
		- combines graphical modelling with classical risk analysis to better represent the threats, risks, assets and treatments. 
		- help of graphical model, control can be placed at right level; it increases communication efficiency and makes result understandable for broad range of people
		- ![[Pasted image 20250512101426.png]]
- **What is CORAS**-
	- a model-based risk analysis process designed specifically for security-critical systems
	- framework procides a structured approach for identifying, assessing and managing risks in complex systems
	- leverages graphical modelling to facilitate risk communication between stakeholders and offers various tools and techniques for modeling and documenting risk factors
	- **Overview**- 
		- CORAS semantics are a schematic translation of any CORAS diagram into english
		- CORAS guideline is a guideline for the best use of graphical language within the process
		- CORAS tool is a computerised tool supporting the above
	- **Types**- different types of diagrams
		- **Asset Diagrams**- devsribe the focus of the analysis
		- **Threat Diagrams**- describe scenarios that may cause harm to the assets
		- **Risk Diagrams**- summarise the risks presented in the threat diagrams
		- **Treatment Diagrams**- add proposed treatments to the threat diagrams
		- **Treatment Overview Diagrams**- add the proposed treatments to the risk diagrams
	- **Symbols**- symbols used in CORAS for graphically representing risk assessment
		- ![[Pasted image 20250512102207.png]]
	- **Threat Diagram**- breakdown below helpes visualise relationships between threats, vulnerabilities, assets, and unwanted incidents
		- ![[Pasted image 20250512102255.png]]
		- after exploring the CORAS process definition, semantics, guidelines, tools and types. now explore semantics translated into english (vertices and relations), providing clear structure for visualising and understanding risks. leads to crucial phases like identifying and documenting assets, followed by other key phrases like identifying threats, evaluating risks and selecting appropriate risk treatments
	- **CORAS Semantics Translated to English**- CORAS method is crucial to understand the vertices and relations used in threat diagrams. 
		- **Vertices**- represent elements like assets, threats or unwanted incidents
			- a hacker is a deliberate human threat
			- threat scenario- power supply breakdown in Norway, likeelihood undefined
			- threat scenario- power supply breakdown in Sweden, with a likelihood of once every 5 years
			- unwanted incident- blackout in Norway, with a likelihood of occurring 3 times every 100 years
			- power production in Norway is a direct asset
		- **Relations**- illustrate connections between them, such as cause-and-effect scenarios
			- a hacker initiates a power supply breakdown in Norway with a likelihood of once every 100 years
			- power supply breakdown in Norway leads to a blackout in Norway with a conditional likelihood of 1.0
			- power supply breakdown in Sweden leads to a blackout in Norway with a conditional likelihood of 0.1
			- blackout in Norway impacts power production in Norway with a consequence classified as critical
	- **CORAS Semantics and Diagrams**- the semantics are essential in the breakdown of a CORAS diagram as they illustrate how risks and threates are identified, managed or mitigated. by using distinct symbols and relationships, the diagram visually clarifies which treatments are applied to specific threats, facilitating a better understanding of overall risk management strategy
		- ![[Pasted image 20250512103223.png]]
- **CORAS Risk Management Phases**-
	- the CORAS method follows structured process that helps organisations manage and mitigate risks systematically. each phase is designed to capture essential aspects of risk management, from identifying valuable assets to selecting appropriate risk treatments. The phases are:
	1. **Identifying and Documenting Assets**- first step in effective risk management is identifying and docuemting assets
		- **Asset**- assets refer to something to which a party assigns value and hence requires protection
			-  need to list down all assets into the diagram
		- **Client's Role**- the client specifies its assets and risk acceptance levels
		- **Common Pitfalls**- mistakes in this step can jeopardise the entire analysis
			- wrong focus
			- wrong level of detail
		- Key assets of the analysis client- including 'Product Information', 'Budget', and 'Business Contracts'
			- **Asset Diagram**- below
			- ![[Pasted image 20250512114431.png]]
		- may also specify interested parties other than the client
			- different parties may have different assets
			- two parties may assign different values to the same assets or aspects (eg confidentially) but possible with different priorities (asset value) and different protection requirements
		- also possible to specify how assets can depend on other assets
			- **Indirect assets**- 
				- company reputation
			- **Direct assets**-
				- income
		- Shows relationship between confidentiality and data protection, emphasising that harm to confidentiality can lead to harm to data protection
			- ![[Pasted image 20250512114813.png]]
	2. **Identifying and Documenting Threats and Unwanted Incidents in the Threat Diagram**- once assets are documented, its important to identify potential threats and unwanted incidents that could disrupt these assets, using threat diagrams visualise these potential incidents and their consequences
		- essential to define key terms
			- **Threat**- potential cause of an unwanted incident
			- **Unwanted Incident**- an event that harms or reduces the value of an asset
		- Below visualises how these elements interact and how specific threats may lead to unwanted incidents that reduce asset value
			- ![[Pasted image 20250512120006.png]]
		- Further clarify the elements involved in risk management, define additional terms
			- **Vulnerability**- weakness or deficiency that can be exploited by a threat to cause harm or reduce the value of an asset
			- **Threat Scenario**- chain of events initiated by a threat, potentially leading to an unwanted incident
		- Participants need to specify 'why' incidents can happen (vulnerabilities) and 'how' (threat scenarios)
		- below shows the flow of different types of threats and unwanted incidents and their impacts on business assets like contracts, product information and budget. highling how various vulnerabilities, such as insufficient virus protetion or access to confidential information can lead to incidents like attacks on the information system, accidental publication of product information or confidential data being sold
			- ![[Pasted image 20250512120930.png]]
	3. **Identifying and Documenting Likelihoods and Consequences**- since identified the threats and unwanted incidents, next step is to assess how likely these incidents are to occur and their potential impact on assets
		- important to understand
			- **Likelihood**- frequency or probability of something to occue
			- **Consequence**- impact of an unwanted incident on an asset in terms of harm or reduced asset value
		- Below helps to clarify how the probability of an event and potential consequences are analysed to determine the overall risk
			- ![[Pasted image 20250512121244.png]]
		- 
	4. **Documenting Risks**- focus on documenting risks based on identified threats, assets, and vulnerabilities
		- **Risk**- refers to likelihood of unwanted incident and its consequences for a specific asset, acceptable and non-acceptable risks are shown in a risk diagram to aid decision-making and planning treatments
		- below shows the relationship between various risks and their impact on critical business assets, such as business contracts, product information and budget. illustrates different risks like a virus attack or the accidental release of confidential information can affect these assets. each risk is assessed for its acceptability or unacceptability helping to determine which risks require treatment and which can be tolerated
			- ![[Pasted image 20250512121937.png]]
	5. **Identifying and Documenting Risk Treatments**- once risks are documented, next step is to determine appropriate risk treatments
		- **Unacceptable risks**- are evaluated to identify appropriate treatments
		- **Acceptable risks**- can be removed from the diagram
		- below shows example of risk diagram where various risks are visualised and categorised based on their acceptability to organisation
			- ![[Pasted image 20250512122101.png]]
		-  highlighted risks help in identifying those that need mitigation versus those that can be tolerated without further action
		- risk treatment refers to an appropriate measure to reduce the risk level, treatments are added where they should have an effect
		- below shows risk treatments being implemented for previously identified risks, illustrating how specific countermeasures are applied to reduce the risk level associated with various threats and vulnerabilities
			- ![[Pasted image 20250512125321.png]]
- **Example of CORAS Threat Diagrams**- following are five CORUS threat diagrams that illustrate concepts such as identification, vulnerabilities, threats and their potential impact on an organisation
	- **Example 1**- below shows the relationship between a companys key resource, such as server integrity, information confidentiality and system availability. demonstrating how these critical assets, when compromised can negatively impact the companys reputation
		- ![[Pasted image 20250512130101.png]]
	- **Example 2**- below demonstrates a typical scenario where external attackers, such as hackers or malicious software, can exploit vulnerabilities like outdated virus protection, highlighting possible paths threats can take, from initiating an unwanted incident to causing serious consequences such as breaches in confidentiality, integriyt, or availability of servers. this mapping of threats relations and their potential impacts it helps visualise how different threats interct with vulnerabilities and the likelihood and severity of each possible outcome
		- ![[Pasted image 20250512130246.png]]
	- **Example 3**- below provides an illustration of how a hacker or computer virus can initiate risk relations that impact a companies servers confidentiality, integrity and availability. it illustrates different scenarios where these risks may be deemed acceptable or unacceptable base don severity of impact. highlights visualusing levels and how they affect critical assets in the system by mapping out the relationships between threats, risks and their consequences
		- ![[Pasted image 20250512130514.png]]
	- **Example 4**- below demonstrates how preventative actions, usch as installing monitoring software or updating virus protection routines, can reduce likelihood and consequences of attacks on a companies critical assets. mapping out potential treatment scenarios, the diagram illustrates how these actions can prevent or minimise the impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability of companies servers
		- ![[Pasted image 20250512130628.png]]
	- **Example 5**- below outlines how specific treatments, like installing monitoring software or updating virus protection routeins, can reduce the likelihood and consequences of attacks on critical assets like servers. shows relationships between threats, risks and treatment actions, emphasising how effective measures can protext the confidentiality, integriy and availability of vital systems
		- ![[Pasted image 20250512130748.png]]
- **Eight Steps of CORAS Risk Analysis**-
	- in the steps below it is in a case sudy for a telemedicine case study, which involves identifying and managing potential risks in a healthcare setting where patients and healthcare professionals use digital tools for remote communication and treatment
		- telemedicine introduces new risks, such as threats to patient privacy, unauthorised access to sensisitve medical data, and disruptions in communication between healthcare providers like GPs and specialists
		- telemedicine system connects various stakelholders and is crucial for delivering timely healthcare services, CORAS method allows identifiation of assets like patient data and communication channels, potential threats like system vulnerabilities and estimation of risks to mitigate them effectively
	- the process follows a structured step-by-step approach to identifying, estimating, evaluating and treating risks, eight key steps of CORUS risk analysus process are:
		1. **Preparation for Analysis**-
			- aims to complete essential preparations before beginning the analysis
			- involves setting a preliminary scope and focus for analysis and informing the customer of their responsibilities
		2. **Customer Presentation of the Target**-
			- the second step an introductory meeting is held where the client representatives outline their overall goals and the specific target for the analysis, analysts gather the information from these presentations and discussions
			- key tasks include introducing security analysis method, defining the analysis goals and scope, planning subsequent meetings and workshops and setting the particiapnts
			- essential participants include the analysis leader, secratary and client decision-makers with optional involvement from technical experts and users
			- **Modelling Guideline**-
				- early stage of the analysis it can be useful to describe the target with information drawings, pictures or sketches on a blackboard. below shows an example of telemedicine case, the presentation can later be supplemented with more formal modelling techniques such as Unified Modeling language (UML) or data flow diagram
				- ![[Pasted image 20250512131943.png]]
				- 
		3. **Refining the Target Description Using Asset Diagrams**-
			- third step a follow up meeting is held with the clients representatives, where analysts present their initial understanding of the first meeting and any client-provided documentation
			- a high-level securiy analysis is conducted to idetnify prelimnary threats, vulnerabilities, threat scenarios and unwanted incidents, helping to refine the scope for detailed analysis
			- require participants include the security analysis leader, secretary, client decision-makers and technical experts with optional input from users
			- **Modelling Guideline for the Target Description**- 
				- when refining target description during risk analysis use a formal or standardised notation such as UML but ensure that notation is explained thoroughly so that participants understand it
				- create models of both statis and dynamic features of the target
					- **Static Features**- static may be hardware configurations, network design etc, recommended using UML class diagrams and UML collaboration diagrams (or similar notations)
						- **Class Diagram**-
							- ![[Pasted image 20250512132615.png]]
						- **Collaborative Diagram**-
							- ![[Pasted image 20250512132627.png]]
					- **Dynamic Features**- may include work processes, information flow, recommended UML activity diagrams and UML sequence diagrams (or similar notations) for dynamic parts
						- **Activity Diagram**-
							- ![[Pasted image 20250512132721.png]]
			- **Symbols from the CORAS Risk Modelling Language**-
				- next step in refining tarrget description is to model interactions, assets and risks relevant to the analysis. fully understand risk scenarios and model them efficiently, we rely on symbols from CORAS risk modelling lanague. these symbols represent threats, vulnerabilities, assets and other key elements needed for risk identification and treatment
				- below shows CORAS symbols for risk modelling diagram
					- ![[Pasted image 20250512132903.png]]
			- **Asset Diagram**-
				- essential for mapping the organisations critical assets that could be impacted by threats or vulnerabilities, it helps identify what needs protection and forms the basis for subsequent risk assessment
				- below shows key assets like customer databases and online services
					- ![[Pasted image 20250512132958.png]]
			- **High-Level Risk Table**-
				- high-level risk table is next crucial element in documenting and prioritising risks, the table is used to categorise identified risks by their potential impact and likelihood
				- ![[Pasted image 20250512133047.png]]

		4. **Approval of Target Description**-
			- fourth step, a detailed subscription of the analysis target is refined, including assumptions and preconditions, this step concludes with client approval of the documentation
			- key tasks involve approcing the target and asset descriptions, ranking assets by importance, setting consequeunce and likelihood scales for each asset and establishing risk evaluation criteria
			- the required participants mirror those from previous meeting emphasising the presence of decision-makers to set clear boundaries for the ongoing analysis
			- **Asset Table**- helps organise and document critical assets within the telemedicine system, 
				- beloiw typically lists each asset and its corresponding importance to the system, allowing stakeholders to focus on high-priority areas during analysis
				- ![[Pasted image 20250512133510.png]]
			- **Consequence Scale for Health Records**-
				- consequences scale measures the impact of an unwanted incident on health records, ensuring that all participants understand the severity of possible risl
				- below shows example of consequence scale
				- ![[Pasted image 20250512133556.png]]
			- **Likelihood Scale**-
				- likelihood scale assesses probability of potential threats materialising. the scale helps prioritise risks by estimating how often such incidents might occur within the telemedicine system
				- below example of likelihood scale
				- ![[Pasted image 20250512133646.png]]
			- **Risk Evaluation Matrix**-
				- risk evaluation matrix combines the consequence and likelihood scales to assess the overall risk level for each identified threat, 
				- below matrix visually represents which risks are critical and require immediate attention
				- ![[Pasted image 20250512133738.png]]
		5. **Risk Identification Using Threat Diagrams**-
			- this step is conducted as a workshop with experts focused on the evaluation target
			- primary aim is to identify a comprehensive list of potential unwanted incidents, threats, vulnerabilities and threat scenarios
			- key tasks include completing initial threat diagrams with identified elements
			- participants should include the security analysis leader, seurity analysis secratary and client representatives, specifically technical experts and users, with decision-makers attending optionally
			- **Threat Diagrams**-
				- after identifying the key people who whould participate in the risk analysis process, next step involves understanding the various threats that could impact the system, 
				- below several diagrams used to visualise and categorise these threats into different ttypes
					- **Initial THreat Diagram- Accidental actions**-

		6. **Risk Estimation Using Threat Diagrams**-
			- this step is structured as a workshop on estimating the likelihood and consequences of each identified unwanted incident
			- key asks include assigning likelihood estaimtes to threat scenarios, estimating likelihoods for unwanted incidents based on these scenarios and annotating the impact of each incident on assets
			- required participants include the security analysis leader, security analysis secratary and client representatives, prticularely decision-makers nad technical experts on the target and users
			- **MOdelling Guideline**-
				- for risk estimation on threat diagrams
					- add likelihood estimates to threat scenarios
					- estimate the likelihood of unwanted incidents, using threat scenarios as a reference
					- annotate each incident-asset relation with a consequence based on the assets consequence scale
			- **Threat Diagram with Estimates**-
				- after completing the modelling guidelines, the next phase of CORAS process involves estimating the risk. this involves assessing the likelihood of each identified threat and determining the potential impact it could hav eon the system
				- threat diagram below with estimates, provides visual represenatation of how various threats relate to assets
					- ![[Pasted image 20250512141758.png]]
			- **The Combined Likelihood Estiamtes Table**-
				- summarises these findings to give a clearer picture of the probability and severity of each threat scenario
				- ![[Pasted image 20250512141837.png]]
		7. **Risk Evaluation Using Risk Diagrams**-
			- the client is presented with an initial overview of the risk landscape, allowing for adjustments and corrections as needed
			- tasks include confirming or adjusting the likelihood and consequence estimates, finalising the acceptable risk areas in the risk matrices, and provinding a risk overview in a diagram
			- the required participants are the security analysis leader, secratary and client-decision makers with optional technical expertise
			- **Risk Evaluation Matrix with Risks Table**-
				- after defining the people who should participate in the risk evaluation process, the next step involves visualsing the colelcted risk data for analysis, 
				- the risk evaluation matrix with risks below provides a framework for comparing identified risks based on their likelihdood and impact
				- ![[Pasted image 20250512142130.png]]
			- **Risk Overview Diagram**-
				- following the matrix, the risk overview diagram below offers comprehensive visual summary of the entire risk landscape, showing how different threats, vulnerabilities and their respective treatments interact
				- ![[Pasted image 20250512142215.png]]
		8. **Risk Treatments Using Treatment Diagrams**-
			- final step focuses on identifying appropriate treatments and evaluating their cost-effectiveness, ideally conducted in a workshop
			- tasks include treatments to threat diagrams, estimating the cost-benefit of each treatment to decide on implemtnation and displaying the treatments within risk overview diagrams
			- partiicapns required for this step are the security analysis leader, secratary and client representatives, including decision-maers, technical experts and users
			- **Treatment Diagram**-
				- visually document how the identified risks will be addressed
				- below diagram provides a structured approach to mapping out risk mitigation strategies, showing how treatments are applied to specific threats and vulnerabilities
