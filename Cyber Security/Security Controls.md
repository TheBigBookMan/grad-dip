## Common Vulnerabilities
- network security vulnerabilities are constantly evolving as threat actors seek new ways to attack computer networks
- **Vulnerability**- a weakness in software, hardware or organisational processes that, when comrpomised can lead to security breach. 
	- **Non-physical**- involve softare or data, such as operating systems unpatched
	- **Physical**- protection of physical assets such as servers
- **Network Vulnerability**-
	- **Malware**-
		- includes trojans, viruses, worms, ransomware
		- malware symptoms include slow ystems, random reboots and unkown processes
		- commonly spread through phishing emails and malicious downloads
		- **Common Types**-
			- **Viruses**- self-replicating and spread through user actions like clicking or copyng
			- **Keyloggers**- track the keystrokes made to steal sensitive data
			- **Worms**- self-replicating without a host program, spreading quickly across networks
			- **Trojan Horses**- disguised as legit software allowing back door access
			- **Ransomware**- asks for money in exchange for access to computer again
			- **Logic Bombs**- logic in code that when executed creates malisiouc code
			- **Bots and Botnets**- compromised system controlled remotely, often used in DDoS attacks
			- **Adware and Spyware**- server ads or steal user information without permission
			- **Rootkits**- provide remote control over a system that is difficult to detect and remove

## NIST (National Isntitute of Standards) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
-  structured guidance that helps organisations assess and continually improve their ability to prevent, detect and respond to cyber-attakcs
- supplies overarching policy framework
- 30 % of US companies use NIST CSF as standard for data protection
- aims to maintaing critical infrastructure including systems and assets so vital to US that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and seets would be debilitating
- voluntary-risk based CSF comprising industry standards and best practices for helping organisations manage cybersecurity tisks
-  NIST CSF is technology-neutral so works across various technology environments
- flexible to work across organisations of all sizes
	- versatile and designed for use of all sizes, maturity levels and sectors
	- not just critical for infrastrcture, non-critical infrastructure organisations can also benefit greatly from its implementation
- Value to programs
	- organisations with matrue cybersecurity programs can use CSF to enhance and refine their existing processes
	- companies looking to establish cybersecurity program can use CSF as foundational framework
	- also complements existing risk management processes, aligning with industry best practices
	- incorporates international standards, making applicable within and outside US
- **Benefits**-
	- **Describe**- describing the current cubersecurity posture allows organisations to understand their exsiting security measures
	- **Target State**- defining target state for cubersecurity helps to set clear goals for security improvements
	- **Identify**- identifying and prioritising opportunities for improvement enures that resources are allocated effectively
	- **Assess**- assessing progress towards the target state enables continous monitoring and adjustment of security measures
	- **Communicate**- communicating about cybersecurity isk among internal and external stakeholders fosters better understanding and collaboration on security issues
- **Implementation through to Business Process**-
	- **Risk Management**- NIST CSF guides key decision points about risk management activities across various levels of an organisation, from senior execs to business and process levels, down to implementation and operations
	- **Senior Exec Level**- primary focus is on manging organisational risk, leaders at this level are responsibile for making critical decisions regarding risk apetite, prioritising key objectives and aligning resources to address the organisations most significant risks
	- **Mission Priority, Risk appetite and Budget**- ensures mission priorities, risk appetite, and budget align with a structured framework profile at business/process level
	- **Business/Process Level**- focus effectively on communicating the mission priorities, availabile resources and overall risk tolerance to the business process level
	- **Changes in Current and Future Risk**- at business/process level, the focus shifts to critical infrastructure risk management
	- **Framework Profile**- actions involve selecting the appropriate profile and allocating the budget, inputs from exec level are used to understand priority and current and future risk is communicated back up to exec level. level also communicates heavily with implementation/operations level to communicate risk frameworks and oversee the implementation process
	- **Implementation**- focus on securing critical infrasturucture, actions include implementing the selected profile, this level communicates progress on profile implementation back to business/process level
	- **Implementation Progress Changes in Assets, Vulnerability and Threat**- end-to-end risk management process facilitated by the NIST CSF ensures that each level of the organisation is aligned and informed, from strategic decision-making to operational execution
- **Components (Tiers, Core, Profile)**-
	- **Core**-
		- outlines cybersecurity activities and provides information references, all organised around particular outcomes
		- enables communication of cyber risk across an organisation
		- consists of functions, categories, subcategories and informative references
		- functions are to govern (NIST CSF2.0), identify, protect, detect, respond, recover (GIPDRR)
	- **Tiers**-
		- describes how cybersecurity risk is managed by an organisation
		- describes degree to which an organisations cybersecurity risk management practices exhibit the key charactersitics (risk, threat aware, repeatable and adaptive)
		- tier options are - kind of where they are in terms of knoelwedge and awareness
			- partial (tier 1) 
				- ad hoc, reactive
				- limited awareness of cyebrsecurity risks
				- no formal risk management
			- risk- informed (tier 2)
				- risk management practices are approved but not organisation wide
				- some awareness exists
			- risk-informed 
				- policies are established and consistently followed
				- risk management is integrated
			- repeatable (tier 3) and adaptive (tier 4)
				- organisation adapts its cybersecurity approach based on previous incidents and predicitve analysis
				- continous improvement is emphasised
		- each organisation will decide which tier matches its risk management needs and capabilities, not a race to the top
		- appropriate tier depends on the business needs, risk appetite and resources
	- **Profile**-
		- aligns industry standards and best practices to the framework core in a particular implementation scenario
		- supports prioritisation and measurement while factoring in business needs
		- helps organisations progress from their current elvel of cybersecurity sophisitication to a target improved state
- **Framework Implemetation Tiers**
	- provide a deeper context for how an organisation approaches cybersecurity risk. tiers work alongside the Core and Profiles offering insights into processes in place to manage risk
	- **Risk Management Process**- functionality and repeatability of sybersecurity risk management
	- **Integrated Risk Management Program**- extent to which cybersecurity is considered broader risk management decisions
	- **External Participation**- degree to which organisation benefits by sharing or recieving information from outside parties
	- Figure below shows how the tiers range from Tier 1 (partial) to Tier 4 (adaptive) indicating increasing degree of rigour and sophistication in cybersecurity risk management processes, how well integrated cyber risk decisions are into broader risk decisions and the degree to which the organisation shares and recieves cybersecurity info from external parties
	- ![[Pasted image 20250506084702.png]]
	- selection of appropriate tier is responsibility of each individual organisation. the chosen tier must align with the organisations goals, be practical to implement and effectively reduce cybersecurity risks to an acceptable level
- **CSF Core**-
	- set of cybersecurity outcomes arranged by function, category and subcategory
	- outcomes are not a checklist of actions to perform; specific actions taken to achieve an outcome will vary by organisations and use cases, as will individual responsible for those actions
	- the order and size of functions, categories, subcategories in core do not imply the sequence or importance of achieving them. the structure of the core is intended to resonate most with those charged with operationalising risk management within an organisation

	- The core was designed to cover the entire breadth without being overly deep crossing topics across cyber, physical and personnel
	- Covers across Functions->Categories->Subcategories
	- Subcategories are deepest level of abstraction in the core, 97 subcategories and outcome-driven statements that provide considerations for creating or improving a cyebrsercurity program
	- risk management activities can prevent negative evnts occurring but can also support taking advantage of positive opportunities
	- actions to reduce cybersecurity risk benefit organisation in ways such as increasing revenue like first offering excess facility space to a commercial hosting provider for hosting their own and other organisation, then moving a major financial system from the organisation data centre to the hosting provider, reducing risks
	- the actions above should be addressed concurrently, actions that support Govern, Identify, Protect and Detect should all happen continoulsky and actions that support responding and recovery should be ready at all times and happen when cybersecurity incidents occur
	- all functions have vital roles related to cyber incidents
	- Govern, Identify and Protect outcomes help prevent and prepare for incidents, 
	- Govern, Detect, Respond and Recover outcomes help discover and manage incidents
	- Each function named after a verb that summarises its content 
	- each function divided into categories which are related to cybersecurity outcomes that collectively comprise the function
	- categories divided into subcategories into more specific outcomes of technical and management activities. they are not exhaustive but describe detailed outcomes that support each category
	- They all apply to all ICT used by organisations including IT, IoT and OT. also apply to all types of technology environments including cloud, mobile and AI systems
	- ![[Pasted image 20250506093314.png]]
- **Profile**- profile optimisation in NIST Cybersecurity framework involves creating and refining profiles to align cybersecurity activities within organisations business requirements, risk tolerance and resources
	- framework is voluntary so no right or wrong ways to do it
	- organisation can map their cybersecurity requirements, mission objectives and operating methodoloogies along with current practices against subcategoryes of framework Core
	- requrements and objectives can be compared against the current operating state of the organisation to gain understanding of the gaps between the two

## Security Controls
- **Cybersecurity Control**-security controls are safeguards or countermeasures to avoid, detect, counteract or minimse security risks to physical property, information, computer systems  or other assets
- **Types of Security Control**-
	- **Time**- security controls can be classified according to the time that they act relative to  a security incident
		- **Preventative (before the event)**- controls are intended to prevent an incident from occurring (eg locking out unauth intruders)
		- **Detective (during the event)**- contolrs are intended to identify and characterise an incident in progress (eg by sounding the intruder alaram and alerting security guards or police)
		- **Corrective (after the event)**- controls are intended to limit the extent of any damage caused by the incident (eg recovering the organisation to normal working status as efficiently as possible)
	- **Nature**- security controls can also be classified according to their nature
		- **Pyhsical**- controls (eg fences, doors, locks and fire extinguishers)
		- **Procedural or Administrative**- controls (eg incident response processes, management oversight, security awareness and training)
		- **Technical or Logical**- controls (eg use euthentication- login- and logical access controls, anti-virus software, firewalls)
		- **Legal and Regulatory or Compliance**- controls (eg privacy laws, policies and clauses)
- Different security and control frameworks
- ![[Pasted image 20250509082959.png]]

- **CIS Controls**- Critical Securital Controls are a prioritised, community-developed set of defensive practices that mitigate the most prevalant attacks on systems and networks
	- has top 18 critical security controls which are prioritised set of best practices created to stop most pervasive and dangerous threats of today
	- published the best practice guidelines for computer security
	- consisted of 18 critical security controls (CSC) that organisations should take to block or mitigate known attacks
	- included no-nonsense actionable recommendations for cybersecurity
	- distributed as widely and freely as possible
	- provide a detailed, defence-in-depth checklist for day-to-day implementation
- **Why use the CIS Control**-
	- **Offence informs defence**- 
		- CIS controls are selected, dropped and prioritised based on data and specific knowledge of attacker behaviour and how to stop it
	- **Feasible**-
		- all individual recommendations (safeguards) must be specific and practical to implment
	- **Focus**- 
		- help defenders idetnfiy the most critical actions they need to take to stop the most important attacks
		- Avoid the temptation to solve every securirt problem; avoid adding 'good things to do' or 'things you could do'
	- **Measureable**-
		- all CIS controls, especially for implementation Group 1, must be measureable
		- simplify or remove ambiguous language to avoid inconsistent interpretation
		- some safeguards may have a threshold
	- **Align**-
		- create and demonstrate 'peaceful co-existence' with other governance, regulatory, and process management schemes, frameworks and structures
		- cooperate with and point to existing, independent standards and security recommendations where they exists, such as National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), Software Assurance Forum for Excellence in Code (SAFECode), Att&CK and Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)
