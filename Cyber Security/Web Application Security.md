- Web application is app stored on remote server delivered through internet into a browser interface. the servers attact attackers
- secure web app needs protect backend database, server application, network and app itself
- security requirements align with general security goals includeing:
	- CIA triad
	- IAAA (identification, authentication, authorisation and Accounting)
	- non-repudiation
- **Web Server**-
	- 2 parts
		- **Web Client**- 
			- generally browsers and other related tools that let users send requests to web server
		- **Web Server**-
			- based on request (if valid) fetches related resources from database and sends back the data to client as response to initial request
	- Resources can be two types
		- **Static**- resources consist of information that doesnt change frequently- html, js
		- **Dynamic**- information that changes frequently, web server builds part of the response on the fly using latest information and sends to the web client- json built on the fly with business logic

- **Hypertest Transfer Protocol (HHTP)**-
	- most web clients with GUI communicate over web server using HTTP without using GUI
	- it is a request-response protocol used to transfer resources between client and server
- **What is Risk**-
	- the intersection of a threat, a weakness and an asset- Risk = Likelihood X Impact
	- attacker can use different ways to access resources or create disruption. each path is called an **attack vector**
	- below shows an attack vector
		- each path represents a risk that may or may not cause serious damage
		- sometimes identifying these paths is trvial, sometimes extremely dofficult
		- impact could be minor or catastrophic for business
		- identifying risk can help business implement proper controls against attaks
		- projects such as Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) help us understand and learn about common risks related to web apps
