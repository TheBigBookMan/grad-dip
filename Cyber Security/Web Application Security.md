- Web application is app stored on remote server delivered through internet into a browser interface. the servers attact attackers
- secure web app needs protect backend database, server application, network and app itself
- security requirements align with general security goals includeing:
	- CIA triad
	- IAAA (identification, authentication, authorisation and Accounting)
	- non-repudiation
- **Web Server**-
	- 2 parts
		- **Web Client**- 
			- generally browsers and other related tools that let users send requests to web server
		- **Web Server**-
			- based on request (if valid) fetches related resources from database and sends back the data to client as response to initial request
	- Resources can be two types
		- **Static**- resources consist of information that doesnt change frequently- html, js
		- **Dynamic**- information that changes frequently, web server builds part of the response on the fly using latest information and sends to the web client- json built on the fly with business logic
	- ![[Pasted image 20250521101004.png]]
- **Hypertest Transfer Protocol (HHTP)**-
	- most web clients with GUI communicate over web server using HTTP without using GUI
	- it is a request-response protocol used to transfer resources between client and server
- **What is Risk**-
	- the intersection of a threat, a weakness and an asset- Risk = Likelihood X Impact
	- attacker can use different ways to access resources or create disruption. each path is called an **attack vector**
	- below shows an attack vector
		- each path represents a risk that may or may not cause serious damage
		- sometimes identifying these paths is trvial, sometimes extremely dofficult
		- impact could be minor or catastrophic for business
		- identifying risk can help business implement proper controls against attaks
		- projects such as Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) help us understand and learn about common risks related to web apps

## Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP)
- identifies the 'top 10' most serious risks for a broad array of organisations. each risk there is generic information about the likelihood and technical impact is provided using a risk rating framework
- framework uses these factors to assess and rate security risks
	- **Exploitability**- refers to how easily or difficult an attacker can exploit the vulnerability
	- **Weakness Prevalence**- indicates how common a specific vulnerability is across applications
	- **Weakness Detectability**- measures how easily the vulnerability can be detected during the development or testing phases
	- **Technical Impact**- assesses the potential damage or consequences for the system
	- **Business Impact**- reflects the broader consequences for the organisation, such as financial losses or reputational damage
	- ![[Pasted image 20250522084220.png]]
- The top 10 represents a broad consensus about most critical security risks to web apps

- **2021s top 10 risks in terms of current web application industry, common web vulnerabilities, detection and prevention**
	- **Broken Access Control**- when access control mechanisms fail, attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorised data and systems. UNderstanding how to properly secure access points is crucial
		- **Vulnerabilities**-
		- **Detections**-
		- **Preventions**-
		- **Threat Agents/Attack Vectors**-
		- **Impacts**-
	- **Crytpographic Failues**- this risk highlights the importance of securing sensitive data through robust encryption methods. Weak encryption or improper handling of cryptographic keys can lead to data breaches
		- **Vulnerabilities**-
		- **Detections**-
		- **Preventions**-
		- **Threat Agents/Attack Vectors**-
		- **Impacts**-
	- **Injection**- One of the most common and dangerous risks is when attackers send malicious code through input fields to exploit vulnerabilities in an application
		- **Vulnerabilities**-
		- **Detections**-
		- **Preventions**-
		- **Threat Agents/Attack Vectors**-
		- **Impacts**-
	- **Insecure Design**- ensuring security is built into the design of applications from the ground up, preventing weaknesses that could be exploited later
		- **Vulnerabilities**-
		- **Detections**-
		- **Preventions**-
		- **Threat Agents/Attack Vectors**-
		- **Impacts**-
	- **Security Misconfiguration**- incorrectly configured settings can leave applications open to attack. Regular updates and proper configuration management are essential
		- **Vulnerabilities**-
		- **Detections**-
		- **Preventions**-
		- **Threat Agents/Attack Vectors**-
		- **Impacts**-
	- **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**- using outdated software components increases the risk of known vulnerabilities being exploited. Its critical to stay up-to-date
		- **Vulnerabilities**-
		- **Detections**-
		- **Preventions**-
		- **Threat Agents/Attack Vectors**-
		- **Impacts**-
	- **Identification and Authentication Failures**- weak authentication mechanisms allow attackers to bypass identity checks, gaining access to systems without proper authorisation
		- **Vulnerabilities**-
		- **Detections**-
		- **Preventions**-
		- **Threat Agents/Attack Vectors**-
		- **Impacts**-
	- **Software and Data Integrity Failures**- trusting unverified code or data sources can introduce malicious software into your systems
		- **Vulnerabilities**-
		- **Detections**-
		- **Preventions**-
		- **Threat Agents/Attack Vectors**-
		- **Impacts**-
	- **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**- without proper monitoring and logging, breaches may go undetected for long periods, increasing damage
		- **Vulnerabilities**-
		- **Detections**-
		- **Preventions**-
		- **Threat Agents/Attack Vectors**-
		- **Impacts**-
	- **Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF)**- SSRF occurs when an attacker tricks a server into accessing unintended locations, potentially exposing sensitive data
		- **Vulnerabilities**-
		- **Detections**-
		- **Preventions**-
		- **Threat Agents/Attack Vectors**-
		- **Impacts**-
