- **Cyberseucirty**- 
	- the technologies and procesuders intended for sagefuarding computers, networks and dat afrom unlawfal admittance, weaknesses and attacks transported through the internet
	- ongoing effort to protect digitual information from unauthorised access or modification mitigate possible exploits and implement plans for disaster recovery
- **Importance of Cybersecurity**-
	- making sure infrastutre and ifnormation protected
	- for everyone now, everyone responsibility: IT, workers, everytone
	- key business aspect as well
	- Goals- making sure information and data are being colelted part of business process protected from internal people and external like internet

	- key infrastructre at risk of advanced attacks
- **Four types cybresecurity**-
	- **Computer**- process of preventing any unauthorised use of your computer, prevention measures stop unauth users attempting to break into your system
	- **Data**- protecting data from corruption and unauthed access, ensure privacy while protecting personal and corporate data
	- **Network**- protecting your network, protect usability, reliability, integrity and safety of network and data
	- **Pyshical**- protection of hardware, programs, networks and dat afrom physical access. things like fire, natural disasters, buglary, theft, vandalism and terroism

## Design Concepts
- design elemetns are necessary to consider when building a system to make sure core security principles (CIA and AAA) are implemented
- ![[Pasted image 20250504194855.png]]
- **Need to Know**- 
	- access authorisation scheme which subjects right to access and object takes into consideration not just privilege level but relevance of data inbolbed in the role subject plays
	- indivate the subject requires access to objet only when specificly necessary to their job
	- so if the privlege runs out  then they cant access
- **Least Privilege**-
	- minimum necesarry access that is require to perform a task should be assigned
	- anyuone that does not have privilege will be able to access\
- **Separation of Duties**-
	- builds on least privilege
	- requires use of granular access permissions
	- each type of priiellge operation, should be different roles in the system- ensure subject only gets essential roles and privileges
- **Defence in Depth**-
	- having security measures at each critical level of security infrastructure
	- **ADministrative**- plicies, planning and training
	- **Physical**- covers aspects such as cameras and locks
	- **Perimeter**- firewalls, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), segmentation and virtual local area networks (VLANs)
	- **Network**- addresses authenticatred routing protocols, control plane policing and network device handling
	- **Host**- advanced malware protection and antivurs
	- **APplication**- robustness testing, best practices and fuzzing
	- **Data**- safeguarding data traversing the network
- **Fail Secure**-
	- system should consist of secure state where only certain essential operations can be performed and all access are blocked
	- event of failure the system should fall back to secure state allowing essentitl tasks to repair
- **Economy of Mechanisms**-
	- security mechanisms should be simple as possible
	- complex system design makes harder to audit and erros can easily be overlooked
	- simplified system easier to audit, find errors and resolve them
- **Complete Mediation**-
	- every access to every object must be checked for security and efficiency
	- whenever subject attempts to access objet, system must check priveleges
	- if action permitted then system will allow access otherwise bvlock
- **Open Design**-
	- success of mechanism should not depend on it being secret
	- securit through obscurity does not work in most cases
	- secret eventually gets out and insiders will know sever
	- open design gets assurance from many critics so more chance to imprve
- **Least Common Mechanism**-
	- minimise the number of mechanisms common to more than one user and depended on by all users
	- shared mechanism is potential information path so shared mehcnaism should be minimsed for control
- **Psychological Acceptability**-
	- user interfac emust be easy to use so that users routinely and automatically apply mechniasms correctly
	- should not add difficulty of accessing resources with extra security
- **Weakest Link**-
	- weakest point of a system should be identified and reinforced
	- least valuable resources or privelelges are not secured properly and as result they turn into a weak link the system security
	- strength of a security system is only as strong as the weakest link
- **Leveraging Existing Components**-
	- in a system, existing code or functionality should be reused when possible
	- ensures that attack surface is kept to a minimmum by not introducing new vulnerabilities when adding new code to system

## McCumber Cube
- provides structured framework that inrgrates these principles into a comprehensive approach ti information security
- Cube expands on the ideas of the others by organising security efforts across three key dimensions
- **Security Goals**- evaluating and protecting cybersecurity
	- **Confidentiality**- sensitive data should not be disclosed to unauthorised people or process
	- **Integrity**- data could be changed accidentily or maliciously, mechanisms to detect and roll back accidental or malicious changes should be in place
	- **Availability**- authorised users or processes should be able to access dat aor the system when necessary
- **Information States**- safeguarfing data in transit, at rest and in process states. achieved by backing up data, using strong cryptographic mechanisms to encrypt/decrypt data and verifying integrity and authenticity of data
	- **Transmission**- data needs to be protected while traveling between systems, end-to-end encryption can protect data from thuird party access and verification of integirty and authenticity can identify if data undchanged and if coming from correct sources
	- **Storage**- stored in dvecies (cloud, hard disk etc) need to be protected, backups should happend regularly and be stored in separate safge and secure place, both data and backups should be encrypted using strong crytpographic mechanism
	- **Processing**- data needs to be protected while it is being used in any operation, should onjly access data that is essential for the task, and should be isolated so that other ongoing processes cannot access that data
- **COuntermeasures**- types of solutions or weapons organisationg uses to protect cyberspace
	- **Technology**- hardware and software solutions for prevention and detection systems (IDs, firewaless)
	- **Policies & Practice**- procedures and guidelines that ensure an organisation follows good practices
	- **People**- Measures to ensure awareness among the system users about potential dangers
