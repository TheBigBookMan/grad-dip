- **Cyberseucirty**- 
	- the technologies and procesuders intended for sagefuarding computers, networks and dat afrom unlawfal admittance, weaknesses and attacks transported through the internet
	- ongoing effort to protect digitual information from unauthorised access or modification mitigate possible exploits and implement plans for disaster recovery
- **Importance of Cybersecurity**-
	- making sure infrastutre and ifnormation protected
	- for everyone now, everyone responsibility: IT, workers, everytone
	- key business aspect as well
	- Goals- making sure information and data are being colelted part of business process protected from internal people and external like internet
	- increase in advancements of digitisation, sybersecurtity needs to keep up with advancements of hacking techniques
	- key infrastructre at risk of advanced attacks
- **Four types cybresecurity**-
	- **Computer**- process of preventing any unauthorised use of your computer, prevention measures top unauth users attempting to break into your system
	- **Data**- protecting data from corruption and unauthed access, ensure privacy while protecting personal and corporate data
	- **Network**- protecting your network, protect usability, reliability, integrity and safety of network and data
	- **Pyshical**- protection of hardware, programs, networks and dat afrom physical access. things like fire, natural disasters, buglary, theft, vandalism and terroism
- **CIA Triad**- most foundational and crucual pinciples and concepts for cybersecurity. Attack on the system can come down to one of these three
	- **Confidentiality**- principle of protecting sensitive information against access and disclosure to unauthorised entities
		- **Breaches**- can be breached intentionally (disgrunteld employees) or unintentionally (human error, oversight)
			- attacks designed to gain unath access to systems, apps, dataases to steal or tamper with data
			- caputring and deciphering network traffic
			- electronic eavesdropping (sniffing)
			- escalation of system privileges and then stealing password files or other sensitive information
			- social engineering to get seneitive information
			- psyhical eavesdropping (shoulder surfing)
		- **Events**- scenarious where confidentially is comprimsed
			- failing to properly encrypt a transmission
			- failing to fully authenticate a remote system before transferring data
			- leaving open otherwise secured access points
			- accessing malicious code that opens a back door
			- misrouted faces, documents left on printers
			- walking away from aan access terminal while data is displyaed on the monitor
		- **Countermeasures**- organisations must employ robust countermeasres to protect data from unath access
			- data classification and labeling
			- strong access controls and auth mechnaisms
			- encryption of data in process, in transit and in storage
			- steganography
			- remote wipe capaibilities (for stolen or lost devices)
			- adequate training and education of individuals
		- **Concepts, conditions and aspects**- define and influecne confedentiality
			- *Sensitivity* - could cause harm or damage if disclosed
			- *Criticality*- level to which information is mission critical
			- *Privacy*- keeping information confidential that is personally identifiable or that might cause harm, embarassment or disgrace to someone if revealed
			- *Seclusion*- involces storing somtehing in an out-=opf the way location
			- *Isolation*- act of keeping something separated from others
	- **Integrity**- principle ofprotecting information against improper modifciation ensuring accuracy, consistency and trusthworthiness of data during its entire life cycle
		- **Breaches**- 
			- *Three perspectives*-
				1. Preventing unath subjects from making modifications
				2. Preventing authorised subjects from making unath modifications, such as mistakes
				3. Maintaining the internal and external consitecy of objects so that their data is a correct and true reflection of the real world and any relationship with any child, peer or parent objkect is valid, consistent mand verifiable
			- *Breached by*-
				- viruses
				- logic bombs
				- unath access
				- erros in coding and apps
				- malicious modification
				- intentional replacement
				- system back doors
		- **Events**- events can lead to an integrity breach
			- acceidently deleting files
			- executing malicious code, such as trojan horse
			- introducing a virus
			- altering config, including erros in commands, codes and scripts
			- entering invalid data (SQL injection, cross-site scripting, fake network packets)
		- **Countermeasures** - 
			- data classification and labeling
			- strong access controls and authentication mechanisms
			- encryption of data in process, in transit and in storage
			- steganography
			- remote wipe capaibilities (for stolen or lost devices)
			- adequate training and education of individuals
		- **Concepts, conditions and aspects**-
			- accuracy
			- comprehensiveness
			- completeness
			- responsbility
			- accountability
			- non-reputation
			- validity
			- authenticaity
			- truthfulness
- **Availability**- assurance that the systems responsible for delivering, storing and processing information are accessible when needed
	- **Breaches**- 
		- numerous threats to availability
			- network congestion
			- outage
			- device failure
			- software errors
			- environmental issues
		- availability can be breached by attacks that focus on violation of availability
			- DoS (denial of service) attack
			- object destruction
			- communication interruptions
	- **Events**
		- accidentally deleting files
		- mislabeling or incorrectly classifying assets
		- under-allocating resources
		- overutilising a hardware or software component
	- **Countermeasures**- most policies as well as busines continuity planning (BCP) focus on fauly tolerance features on various levels of access/storage/security with goal of eliminating single poiints of failure to maintain availabiligy of critical systems
		- designing intermediary delivery systems properly
		- using access controls effectively
		- monitoring performance and network traffic
		- using firewalls and routers to prevent DoS attacks
		- implementing redundancy for critical systems
		- maintaining and testing backup systems
	- **Concepts, conditions and aspects**-
		- usability
		- timeliness
		- accessibility

## Authentication, Authorisation and Identification (AAA)
- extension of the CIA triad
	- **Authentication**- mechanism of verifying the identity of a user to prevent unauthorised access
		- system requiring users to enter username and password for access
