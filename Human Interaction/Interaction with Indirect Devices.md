## Mouse Interaction
- computer mouse invented in 60s
- originally a block
- originally referred to as 'X-Y position indicatory for a display system'
- **Indirect Input Device**-
	- functions by detecting two-dimensional motion relative to its supporting surface
	- hand operated electronic device that controls coordinates of a cursor on computer screen as user moves it around on a surface
	- generally perforam following actions
		- *Left Clicking*- user clicks left button of the mouse
		- *Right Clicking*- user clicks right button of the mouse
		- *Double Clicking*- user clicks a mouse button (usually left) twice in quick succession. time interval seaprates the two clicks is determined by mouse settings on OS
		- *Dragging*- presses and holds down left mouse button then moves the mouse while still holding down left mouse button. usualy moves objects or select objects on screen
		- *Scrolling*- moves the scroll wheel in the middle of the mouse to scroll up and down on any page
- **Mouse Types**-
	- **Mechanical Mouse**-
		- type of computer mouse that has a rubber or metal ball on underside that can roll in every direction
		- not common these days
	- **Optical Mouse**-
		- relies entirely on one or more light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and an imaging array of photodiodes (semiconductor p-n junction device that converts light into an electrical current) to detect movement relative to underlying surface
		- when mouse moves or user clicks a button, sends 3 bytes of data to computer
		- first 8 bits contain
		- ![[Pasted image 20250801085733.png]]
		- next 2 bytes contain X and Y movement values
- **Properties of the Mouse**-
	- **Sense Motion**- the mouse uses a light source; LED and a light detector to detect movement relative to a surface
	- **Relative Input Device**- input controls the relative position of the cursor
	- **Indirect Input Device**- one must move the mouse to point to a spot on the screen
- **Control to CD Ratio**-
	- ratio between movement of the input device and the coresponding movement of the object it controls
	- describes the proportion between movements in the control space to the movements in the display space
	- example- a mouse moves in a different spoeed or distance from the cursor on the screen
	- these movements take place in two different spaces, units of measurement must be same to be meningful (eg metrics instead of pixels)
	- C:D gain refers to scale factor of these two mvoements
	- ![[Pasted image 20250801194132.png]]
	- **Process of pointing to a target**-
		- **Gross Positinoning**- 
			- getting in the vicinity of a target
		- **Fine Positioning**-
			- final acquisition
	- llow C:D gain the gross positioning time would be short, but fine positioning time would be long
	- which means that high gains it is easier to approach a distant target; with low gains this takes longer
	- high gains hinder the selection of targets, whereas low gains facilitate this process
	- varying C:D gain evokes a trade off between gross positioning time and fine positioning time
	- optimal setting is that which minimises the combined gross and fine positiioning times
	- C:D gain settings can be adjusted in most cases
	- Microsoft, Mac and X Window systems have implemented mechanisms that adapt the C:D gain to users needs (the C:D gain increases when users movement velocity increases)
- **Three State Model**-
	- mouse lifted from supporting surface = state 0
	- state 0 transits to state 1 when lowering the mouse
	- mouse is moved without the button being pushed = tracking (state 1) (user just moves the mouse without interaction)
	- if mouse pointed at an icon and button pressed while moving the mouse = new state (state 2) called dragging

- **Two Novel Mouse Designs**-
	- **The Bubble Cursor**-
		- target acquisition technique based on area cursors
		- improves upon area cursors by dynamically resizing the activation area depending on the proximity surrounding targets
		- such that only one target is selectable at any time
		- empirical studies show that the bubble curosr significantly outperforms point cursor
	- **Ninja Cursor**-
		- technique using multiple cursors simultaneously to make object pointing faseter as average distance from a cursor to distance can be shortened
		- technique intended for using with big screens, where moving cursor for a long distance is a pain for the user
		- mul;tiple cursors shown simultaneously
		- when user moves the real mouse, all cursors will be moved at same tiome

## Keyboard Interaction
- first input device to be used with computers and still major and most widely used input device
- **Different types of keys**-
	- about 100 keys and each key sends different signal
	- alphabetical, numerical, function, cursor movement, modifier, scroll, punctuation mark and other special purpose keys
	- **Alphanumeric Keys**-
		- keys composed of alphabetical and number keys with a few keys (tab, caps, backspace, enter)
	- **Modifier Keys**-
		- shift, alt and ctrl are modifier keys
		- modify input of other keys
		- modifier key is held down then an operation or action of the second key is changed in some way
	- **Function Keys**-
		- F1 to F12 are used to perform special type of operations for the user
	- **Cursor Movement Keys (arrow keys)**-
		- standard keybopards include set of cursor keys
		- enable user to move around the screen without using a mouse
	- **Special Purpose Keys**-
		- IBM compatible keyboards contain 8 special purpose keys, each perform a unique function
		- esc, print screen, scroll lock, pause, insert, delete, windows key and menu key
- **Types of Keyboards**-
	- classify keyboards according to their key arrangements
	- **QWERTY**-
		- most common keyboard
		- invented in 1868
		- original QWERTY had problems
			- many common letter combinations require awkward finger motions
			- many common letter combinations are yyped with one hand
			- most typing is done with the left hand, wghich for most people is the weather hand and reduces speed
			- about 52% typing is doner on the top row, 32% on the home row and 16% on bottom row
	- **Dvorak Keyboard**-
		- built 1936
		- several designs made
		- main objectives were to make typing or keyboard use more rhythmic and user friendlyt by increasing speed and reducing effort and fatigue which reduces error
		- letters typed be alternating between hands which makes typing more rhythnmic, increasing speed, reduces error and reduces fatigue
		- about 22% of typing is done on top row, 70% on home row and 8% on bottom row
		- right hand should do more of the typing because most people right handed 56% keystrokes on right hand side
		- least common letters on bottom row which is hardest to reach row
		- layout also minimises number of keystrokes nmade with weak fingers
		- experiments show speed improvement of 10-15% coupled with reduction of user fatigue
		- intended for english
	- **Chord Keyboard**-
		- enter characters or commands by pressing several; keys together like a piano
		- entered with one hand leaving the other hand free
		- very different, only have 4 or 5 keys are used
		- **Advantages**-
			- extremely compact, simply reduces size of convential keyboard
			- allows text or commands with one hand leaving other hand free
			- chord keyboards can be used in cramped and confied conditions
		- **Disadvantages**-
			- very difficult to use, as only a f ew keys
			- hard to learn, need to spend long time learning how to use the jkeyboard
			- unfamiliar, cannot ransfer skills to other types of keyboards
			- typing can be very slow
			- increases fatigue as work done on one hand
- **Characteristics of Keyboards**-
	- classified according to mechanical properties
		- **Mechanical**-
			- buuilt with high quality
			- spring activated key switches
			- provide tactile feedback
		- **Touchscreen**-
			- input text by tapping a keyboard that appears on screen with fingerts
			- cannot provide tactile feedback inherently
		- **Stylus-driven**-
			- similar touchescreen soft keyboards
			- only different is support digital pen input
	- **Three State Model**-
		- user does not touch key = state 0
		- user topuches a key = state 1 from state 0
		- user presses a key, then a character is input and state 0 transits to state 1
		- if user keeps pressing key the character will be input repeatedly
		- user releases the key, state 2 becomes state 1
		- user lifts finger off key state = state 1 becomes state 0
		- ![[Pasted image 20250802094217.png]]
	- **Skill Acquisition and Skill Transfer**-
		- with practice, users cna memorise location of commoinly used keys relative to the home position of two hands
		- allowing typing with little or no visual attention which is called blind typing
		- blind typing is ability to use procedural memory to find keys fast without using sense of sight, all available fingers like a piano player
		- procedural memory is a specific type of meory that encodes repetitive motor acts
		- once activity is encoded in procedural memoery it requires little conscious effort to perform
		- process of encoding an activity in procedural memeory can be formalised as the power law of practice
			- T is the time to perform the task
			- P is the amount of practioce
			- a and b are constants that fit the curve to observed data as shown
			- ![[Pasted image 20250802094829.png]]
		- changing keyboard can have high learning cost
		- explains why QWERTY keyboard is not optimal from perspective of typing efficiency but still widely used
- **Three Novel Keyboard Designs**-
	- **ShapeWriter (gesture keyboard)**-
		- stoke gesture-based text and command input method
		- instead of tapping each individual letter, the user traces over all letters in a word sequentially on the touchscreen keyboard
		- the user lands in proximity to the keys, and slidesd to next letters, and lifts the key at the end of the word
		- shape formed by the gesture is recognised by the engine
		- system error tolerant and it is not necessary to cross all letters in a word for the system to correctly output the intended word
		- standard feature of phones
	- **Touch Display**-
		- combines physical ergnomic qualities of the conventional keyboard with dynamic display and touch-sensing embedded in each key
		- effectively transforms the keyboard into interactive surface that is seamlessley integrated with interaction space of GUIs
		- extends graphical output, mouse interaction and three-state input to keyboard
		- gave rise to entirely new design of sopace interaction across keyboard, mouse and screen
	- **Zoomboard**- 
		- proliferation of touchscreen devices has made soft keyboards a routinr part of life
		- ultra-small computing platforms like smart watch and ipod nano lack a means of text entry
		- designing keyboards for small touchscreens such as smart watches is challengeing
		- enables text entry on ultra small devices with a soft keyboard
		- design uses interative zooming to enlarge otherwise impossibly tiny keys to comofortable size
		- designed on qwerty layout

## Interaction Elements
- interaction occurs when human performs a task using tech
- two main categories of interaction tasks
	- interaction tasks with a goal (sending an email, burning a CD and enetering a destination in a GPS device)
	- interaction tasks without a goal (browsing the web and chatting with friends on a social networking site)
- Most HCI tasks are in cognitive band of Newells time scale of human action
	- ![[Pasted image 20250802200608.png]]
	- human systems at work are deliberate acts (eg mouse click, button click- 100ms), operations (gesture input- 1s) and unit tasks (search menu items, select them- 10s)
	- **Hard and Soft Controls**-
		- in the past controls were physical, single-purpose devices
		- displays and controls tended to bne physical, single purpose devices
		- controls like hjoysticsk, switches, arrays of switches,m push buttons,keys, keybopards, mice, steering wheels, handles, knobs, levers and so on arrive through an involved process of engineering etc
		- once built, they were fixed for life- called hard controls
		- advent of computers with software, graphical displays and point and click interactions changed this
		- interfaces created in software and rendered on a display are called soft controls
		- through soft interfaces, the way humans interact with technology changed
		- distinction between contriols and displays is blurred with soft controls
		- soft control is rendered on a display through software, its size, shape or appearance can change dynamically to convery information to the user
		- soft controls have properties of displays
		- toolbar buttons and widgets are typical examples
		- image was captured with the curosr, or I-0beam, positioned inside the text: this
		- image contains two combo boxes and seven buttons
		- each is both a control and a displayu
		- ![[Pasted image 20250802201426.png]]
- **Control-Display Relationships**-
	- when a user graps a computer mouse and moves it to the right, the cursor on the systenms display moves to the right
	- control-displayu relationship is not something userts think about much
	- HCI should be: where the relationship between what a user does and what is experiences is antural, seamless, intuitive and efficient
	- control-display relationships are sometimes called mappings since the relationships attribute how a controller property maps to a display property
	- mouse-cursor example describes a spatial relatiopnship
- **Spatial Relationships**-
	- mouse-cursor relationshiup
	- mapping is congruent because there is an exact spatial correspondence between the controller input and the display output
	- move the nmouse right, cursor goes rightr
	- mapping supports the uysers expectation
	- if relationship is expected and considered by most people within a population, such as a cultuiral, ethnic or geographi group, then the relationship is considered as a anatural relationship
	- Another peropertty is C:D gain (C:D ratiop or devide gain)
		- quantifiwes amount ofg movement in a display object (cursor) for a given amount of movement in a control
		- if a mouse is moved 3cm and cursor also moves 3cm then the C:D gain is 1, if cursor moves 6cm 
		- non linear gains, the term transfer function is used

## Latency
- (lag) is the delay between an input action and the corresponding response on a display
- usually negligible on interactive systems (eg cursor positioning, typing)
- can be noticeable in some settings- remote manipulation or internet access
- frame rate of 10Hz is considered minimial to achieve real-time
- **Modes**-
	- common and sometimes frustrating property of user interaces
	- mode is a functionaning arrangement or condition
	- modes are everywhere (and unavoidable)
	- example-= office phones have modes; a light on means theres a message waiting; light off means no messages
	- stanbdard keyboard has 100 keys eyt can produce 800 key varations using modes by the modifier keys
	- common mode- related when you enter a password in login page
		- if prompted to enter a password and caps lock is in effect, then logging will fail
		- user may not know caps lock is on
	- designing modeless interactions is sometimes viewed as desireable
	- trutyh is modes cant be avoided in most cases
	- example car-0 three modes- neutral, drive and reverse
		- main issues with modes are
			- changing modes
			- feedback
			- making the mode apparent to the user
	- ![[Pasted image 20250802202850.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20250802202900.png]]
- **Interaction Errors**-
	- interaction involves human (sensors, brain, responders) and the machine
	- interaction error happens when system cannot accomodate a users need
	- error may arise from a lack of functionality, loack of afforedance for the user, a lack of general usability ot a lack of appropriate feedback to complete the interaction
	- interaction errors happen only at at the interfaces between interacting systems
	- bad erros are high in consequences and therefore get a lot of attention
	- little errors are low in consequences and therefore teend to linger
