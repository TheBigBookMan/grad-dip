## Mouse Interaction
- computer mouse invented in 60s
- originally a block
- originally referred to as 'X-Y position indicatory for a display system'
- **Indirect Input Device**-
	- functions by detecting two-dimensional motion relative to its supporting surface
	- hand operated electronic device that controls coordinates of a cursor on computer screen as user moves it around on a surface
	- generally perforam following actions
		- *Left Clicking*- user clicks left button of the mouse
		- *Right Clicking*- user clicks right button of the mouse
		- *Double Clicking*- user clicks a mouse button (usually left) twice in quick succession. time interval seaprates the two clicks is determined by mouse settings on OS
		- *Dragging*- presses and holds down left mouse button then moves the mouse while still holding down left mouse button. usualy moves objects or select objects on screen
		- *Scrolling*- moves the scroll wheel in the middle of the mouse to scroll up and down on any page
- **Mouse Types**-
	- **Mechanical Mouse**-
		- type of computer mouse that has a rubber or metal ball on underside that can roll in every direction
		- not common these days
	- **Optical Mouse**-
		- relies entirely on one or more light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and an imaging array of photodiodes (semiconductor p-n junction device that converts light into an electrical current) to detect movement relative to underlying surface
		- when mouse moves or user clicks a button, sends 3 bytes of data to computer
		- first 8 bits contain

		- next 2 bytes contain X and Y movement values
- **Properties of the Mouse**-
	- **Sense Motion**- the mouse uses a light source; LED and a light detector to detect movement relative to a surface
	- **Relative Input Device**- input controls the relative position of the cursor
	- **Indirect Input Device**- one must move the mouse to point to a spot on the screen
- **Control to CD Ratio**-
	- ratio between movement of the input device and the coresponding movement of the object it controls
	- describes the proportion between movements in the control space to the movements in the display space
	- example- a mouse moves in a different spoeed or distance from the cursor on the screen
	- these movements take place in two different spaces, units of measurement must be same to be meningful (eg metrics instead of pixels)
	- C:D gain refers to scale factor of these two mvoements

	- **Process of pointing to a target**-
		- **Gross Positinoning**- 
			- getting in the vicinity of a target
		- **Fine Positioning**-
			- final acquisition
	- llow C:D gain the gross positioning time would be short, but fine positioning time would be long
	- which means that high gains it is easier to approach a distant target; with low gains this takes longer
	- high gains hinder the selection of targets, whereas low gains facilitate this process
