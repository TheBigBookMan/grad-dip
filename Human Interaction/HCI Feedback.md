- **Human Computer Feedback Loop**-
	- ![[Pasted image 20250903143413.png]]
- **Human Factors**-
	- most profound challenges are from humans
	- hard because there are inputs done by the senses
	- output mainly done through the motor control of the effectors
	- ![[Pasted image 20250903143527.png]]
	- **Human Senses**-
		- **Vision**-
			- visual sensory channel is huge because people obtain 80% of their information through sense of light
			- eye works similar to a camera
			- when looking at an object, light reflected from the object enters the eye through the pupil and is focused through the optical components within the eye
			- front of the eye comprises- cornea, iris, pupil and lens and focuses the image onto the retina
			- **Frequency**-
				- property of light leading to the perception of color
				- visible light is a small band in electromagentic spectrum
				- different colors are positioned within the visble spectrum of electromagnetic waves, with violet at one end (390 nanometres) and red at the other end (750 nanometres)
				- ![[Pasted image 20250903144000.png]]
			- **Intensity**-
				- the amount of light falling on a surface
				- quantifying light intensity is complicated because the eyes light sensitivity varies by the wavelength of the light and the complexity of the source (eg single frequency vs mixture of frequencies)
				- **Luminance**- refers to amount of light passing through a given area
					- with luminance comes brightness, a subjective property of the eye that includes perception of the brain
					- unit for luminance is candela per square metre (cd/m2)
			- **Fixations and Saccades**-
				- saccades are type of eye movement used to rapidly move the fovea from one point of interest to another, usually taking 120 ms
				- fixation is when the eye is kept aligned with the target for a specific furation (typically 200 ms)
				- allowing for the image details to be processed

		- **Hearing (Audition)**-
			- detection of sound by humans
			- sound is a vibration that propogates as an acoustic wave through a transmission medium such as a gas, liquid or solid
			- sound is the reception of such waves and their perception by the brain
			- **Frequency**-
				- the rate at which a soundwave completes a cycle is measured in Hertz (Hz)
				- human speech usually falls in the range of 85Hz to 1100Hz
				- humans can hear between 20Hz to 20000 Hz
				- frequency is the number of waves that pass a point for every unit of time
				- ![[Pasted image 20250903145624.png]]
			- **Amplitude**-
				- essence of the volume of sound, measured in decibel (dB)
				- height of the wave, measured from the middle (peak amplitude)
				- ![[Pasted image 20250903145656.png]]
			- **Timbre**-
				- timbre of a sound is what colurs that sound
				- it makes a violin sound different from a piano or your voice to someone elses
				- often called sound quality
			- **Envelope**-
				- sound envelope is how sound changes over time
				- about how sound starts, sustains and stops
		- **Touch**-
			-  give us information about temperature, rexture, pressure, body position and orientation
			- another way of gaining information and feedback about objets and events around us, especially when interacting with them directly
			- touch is just one component of the somatosensory system
			- **Somatosensory System**-
				- includes sensory receptors in the skin,m muscles, bones, joints and otgans that provide information on various physical or environmental phenomena- including touch, temperature, pain and body and limb position
				- **Tactile Feedback**-
					- refers to information provided through the somatosensory system from a body part, such as sfinger when it is in onctact with touching a phgysical object
					- use of touch to communicate with users
					- most people know vibration feeling a mobile phone or rumble in game controller
					- devices have been designed that allow computer to produce output in a form that can be sensed by touch and related senses
					- devices seem to be successful in providing tactile output
					- providing force feedback- where user experienced the computer as a force on their body
				- additional information- temperature, shape, texture, psition of the object or the amount of resistance- is also converyed
		- **Smell and Taste**-
			- **Smell**
				- olfaction
				- ability to perceive odours
				- occurs through sensory cells in nasal cavity
			- **Taste**-
				- gustation
				- direct checmical reception of seat, salty, bitter and sour sensations through the tongue and oral cavity taste buds
			- **Flavour**-
				- is a perceptual process in the brain that occurs through partnering the smell and taste senses
				- less understood than the visual and auditory senses with expert-like finesse
				- complex smells and tastes can be buolt from simpler elements
				- but perceptual processes for this remain a topic of research
				- classification schemes have been developed for specific industries (eg perfume, wine) but they do not generalise to human experiences with other smells and tastes
	- **Human Responders**-
		- used to perform input techniques'
		- always coupled with human senses in executing interaction tasks so there is a need to introduce human responders 
		- through movement or motor control, humans are empowered to affect the environmet around them
		- control occurs through responders- using a finger to text or point, feet to walk or run, eyebrows to frown, vocal cords to speak or torso to learn, movement allows humans to engage with the world around them
		- **Limbs**-
			- human control over computers is associated with limbs
			- fingers, hands and arms we type on keyboards, use mice and press buttons, ghold mobile phones and pres keys, touch and swipe the surfaces of touchscreen phones and tables and wave game controllers
			- legs and feet can also act as responders
			- movement of head can be used as a control for cursor
		- **Voice**-
			- combination of the larynx, and pulmonary pressure in the longs, we can create sounds
			- speech is the most apparent form and primary channel for human communication
			- as input modality, speech must be recognised by algorithms implemented in osftware running on the host computer
		- **Eyes**-
			- eye can sense and perceive the environment/computer
			- it can also act as a controller via saccades and fixations
			- ![[Pasted image 20250903183815.png]]
			- the yes can be used to input characters and view the screens information
				- useful for peoiple with limb disabilities
			- video-based eye-typing system uses a camera to capture eye movement, from which users can type in words by looking at an on-0screen keyboard
			- process divided into two parts
				- eye-tracking system
				- text-entry system
				- ![[Pasted image 20250903183919.png]]
			- Pros
				- good for people with quadriplegia
				- easy to reach remote targets
			- Cons
				- midas tough- lack of analogous functions for single clicking
				- limitations in tracking accuracy
				- calibratiopn errors and drift
