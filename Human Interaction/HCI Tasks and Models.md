- **HCI Tasks**-
	- Five basic tasks in current user interfaces
		- **Pointing**-
			- reaching a target with a cursor startiong from an initial position
			- perfored with various ionput devices including mousem, touchpad, stylus, finger and controller
			- **Steps**- 
				1. move th epointer to the target
				2. press and hold down the button on the mouse or pointing device and release the button, keep the pointer inside the target
			- usually used to sel;ect targets on interfaces
			- natural and straightforward operation for users
			- analogous to target selection operations in the real world
			- many pointing techniques have been propsed in user interface design to improve target selectionm performance
			- **Fitts Law**- used to model act of pointin, either by physically touching an obhject with a hand or finger by pointing to an opbject on a computer monitor using pointing device
		- **Dragging**-
			- aka drag and drop
			- operation where user selects virtual object by grabbing itt and dragging it to a different location or onto another virtual opbject
			- can invoke many kinds of actions or create various types of associations between 2 abstract objects
			- **Example**- grabbing a file and dragging it to another location
			- **Steps**-
				1. move pointer to the object
				2. press and hold down the button on the mouise or pointing device to grab the object
				3. drag the object to the desired location by moving the pointer to this one
				4. drop the object by releasing the button
			- **Advanatages and Disadvantages**-
				- dragging require smore phyiscal effort than moving the same pointing device without holding down any buttons
				- dragging is generally slower and more error prone than pointing
				- extended dragging and dropping can stress the mousing hand
				- drag and drop operations have the advantage of throughtfully chunking together two operands (object to drag and drop location) into a single action
		- **Crossing**-
			- draw a stroke through the boundary of a target to trigger an action
			- crossing-based interfaces are a form of a visual spatial-dependent gesture interface
			- crossing based selection means object acquistiion by crossing its boundary rather than pointing inside its perimeter
			- **Efficiency**-
				- is as efficient as pointing for object selectionm and can be a viable substitute for pointing a clicking
				- practically applied for mouse and trackball input, stylus input, direct finger touch, remote display intercatyion, virtual reality and AR
				- had shorter or not longer time and higher or similar accuracy than pointing
			- **Expresiveness**-
				- crossing is more expensive than equiovalent point and click interfaces
				- we can click a button or cross a bar to trigger an action
				- clicking a button can invoke one command, but crossing the bar and input two commands with two crossing directions
				- ![[Pasted image 20250830103259.png]]
			- **Fluid Composition**-
				- enables fluid composition of commands to develop a more continous style of interaction
				- users can select multiple commands with a single stroke crossing the menu items
				- uiseful for apps such as drawing applications
		- **Steering**-
			- navigate, or steer through a 2D tunnel without touching the boundaries of the tunnel
			- a tunnel is any UI Control that requires thje user to move the cursor or drag finger on tyouchscreen along a pathy that has borders
			- overtstepping the border has conseuquences
			- Examples-
				- drop down menus
				- parameter control sliders
				- scroll bars
				- videio playuback scrubber bars
				- video game elements
			- accessing hierarchial menyus
				- have to navigate down one menu and select an item then a new menu appears
				- have to navigfate down that menu as well without going out of the tunnel (or both menus could close and have to start again)
		- **Gesturing**-
			- made of non-verbal interaction medium and can provide intuitive and natural way to interact with computers
			- gesturing is a free-form uinput method
			- usually without constraints of a user interface elemtns like buttons and slide bars

## HCI Models
- a model is a simplification of reality
- you are modeling something that is complex into a simpkle manner to understand it easier
- **Fitts Law**-
	- one of the most successful quantative models in HCI
	- states the amount of time required to move a pointer to a target area is a function of distance to the target divided by the size of the target
	- ![[Pasted image 20250830155035.png]]
		- D = distance between centres of the start target and end target
		- W = width of end target in direction of travel
		- a and b = constants that depend on the choiuce of input device and are usually determined empirically by regression analysis
		- logarithmex term log2(1+D/W) = point tasks index of difficulty (ID) measured in bits
		- ![[Pasted image 20250830155240.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20250830155254.png]]
- **Index of Difficulty (ID)**-
	- the difficulty of various combinations of D and W
	- ![[Pasted image 20250830155743.png]]

	- **Extending Fitts law from 1D to 2D and 3D**-
	- ![[Pasted image 20250830155853.png]]
	- **Implications for UI Design**-
		- Fitts laws eesentially says that targets should be as big in size as possible
		- derived from W parameter
		- target distance should be as small as possible
		- based on D parameter
		- **Rule of the INfinite Edges**-
			- having a target near edge works well
			- user can move as fast as possible with pointer and edge will stop from going off screen
			- fast to get to target
- **Fitts law for dragging and crossing tasks**-

- **GOMS Model**-
	- specialised human information processor model for HCI observation that describes a users cognitive structure on 4 components
	- 'set of goals, set of operators, set of methods, set of selection rules for choosing among compething methods for goalds' GOMS
	- produces quantiative and qualitative predictions of how people will use a proposed system
	- four main elements
		- **Goals**- symbolic structure that define a state of affairs to be achieved and determine a set of possible methods by which it may be accomplished
		- **OPerators**- elementary perceptual, motor or cognitive acts whose execution is necessary to change any aspect of the users mental state or affect the task environment
		- **Methods**- describe a procedure for accomplishing a goal
		- **Selection Rules**- needed when a goal is attempted and there may be more than onme method available to the user to accomplish it
	- ![[Pasted image 20250830212114.png]]
	- **3 Advantages of GOMS**-
		- while it is not necessarily the most accurate method to measure human-computer interface interaction, it does allow vissibility of all precedural knowledge
		- with it an analyst can easily estimate a particular interaction and calculate it quickl;y and easily
		- this is only possible if the average methods-time measurement data for each specific task have previopiously been measures experimentally to a high degree of accuracy
	- **5 Limitations of GOMS**-
		- GOMS only applies to skilled users, it does not work for beginners or intermediates for errors may alter the data. the model doesnt also apply to learning the system or a user useing it after a long period of not using it
		- a big diasadvantage is the lack of account for errors, even skilled users make errors, but GOMS does not account for errors
		- mental workload is not addressed in the model, making it an unpreditable variable, same applies to fatigue
		- GOMS only addresses the usability of a task on a systeml; it does not address its functionality
		- users personalities, habits or phyiscal restrictions (disabilities) are not accounted for in anyu of the GOMS models, all users are assumed to be exactly the same
- **Keystroke-level Model (KLM)**-
	- predicts hiow long it will take an expert user to accomplish a routine task without errors using an interactive computer system
	- as the simplest GOMS technique, it estimates an execution time for a task is done by lising the sequence of operators and then totalling the execution times for an indvidiual operators
	- KLM makes several simplyfying assumptionsn that make it a restricted version of GOMS
	- the analyst must specify the method used to acoomplish the particular task of itnerest, which typically entails choosing specific task instances
	- **Original KLM 6 Operator Types**-
		- K to press a key or button
		- P to point with a mouse to a target on display
		- H to home hands on the keytboard or other device
		- D to draw a line segment on grid
		- M to mentally prepare to do an action or a closelty related series of primitive actions
		- R to represent the system-response time during with the user has to wait for the system
	- Each of these operatiors has an estimate of execution time, either a single value , parameterised estimate- K is a dependent on typing speed and whether a key or mouse button click, press or release is involved- or a simple approx function

	- **Advantages KLM**-
		- KLM was designed to be a quick, easy-to-use system design tool which means that no deep knowledfge about psychology ios required for its usage
		- task times can be rpedicted (given the limitations) without having to build a protoype and recruit and test users, whjioch saves money and time
	- **Limitations of KLM**-
		- measures only one aspect of eprformance, time, which means execution time and not the time to acquire or learn a task
		- considers only expert users, generally users differ regarding their knowledge and experience of different systems and tasks, motor skills and technical ability
		- it considers only routine unit tasks
		- method has to be specified step by step
		- execution of the method has to be error free
		- mental operator aggregates different mental operations and therefore cannot model a deeper representation of the users mental oeprations. CRUCIAL
