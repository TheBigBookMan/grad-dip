- **HCI Tasks**-
	- Five basic tasks in current user interfaces
		- **Pointing**-
			- reaching a target with a cursor startiong from an initial position
			- perfored with various ionput devices including mousem, touchpad, stylus, finger and controller
			- **Steps**- 
				1. move th epointer to the target
				2. press and hold down the button on the mouse or pointing device and release the button, keep the pointer inside the target
			- usually used to sel;ect targets on interfaces
			- natural and straightforward operation for users
			- analogous to target selection operations in the real world
			- many pointing techniques have been propsed in user interface design to improve target selectionm performance
			- **Fitts Law**- used to model act of pointin, either by physically touching an obhject with a hand or finger by pointing to an opbject on a computer monitor using pointing device
		- **Dragging**-
			- aka drag and drop
			- operation where user selects virtual object by grabbing itt and dragging it to a different location or onto another virtual opbject
			- can invoke many kinds of actions or create various types of associations between 2 abstract objects
			- **Example**- grabbing a file and dragging it to another location
			- **Steps**-
				1. move pointer to the object
				2. press and hold down the button on the mouise or pointing device to grab the object
				3. drag the object to the desired location by moving the pointer to this one
				4. drop the object by releasing the button
			- **Advanatages and Disadvantages**-
				- dragging require smore phyiscal effort than moving the same pointing device without holding down any buttons
				- dragging is generally slower and more error prone than pointing
				- extended dragging and dropping can stress the mousing hand
				- drag and drop operations have the advantage of throughtfully chunking together two operands (object to drag and drop location) into a single action
		- **Crossing**-
			- draw a stroke through the boundary of a target to trigger an action
			- crossing-based interfaces are a form of a visual spatial-dependent gesture interface
			- crossing based selection means object acquistiion by crossing its boundary rather than pointing inside its perimeter
			- **Efficiency**-
				- is as efficient as pointing for object selectionm and can be a viable substitute for pointing a clicking
				- practically applied for mouse and trackball input, stylus input, direct finger touch, remote display intercatyion, virtual reality and AR
				- had shorter or not longer time and higher or similar accuracy than pointing
			- **Expresiveness**-
				- crossing is more expensive than equiovalent point and click interfaces
				- we can click a button or cross a bar to trigger an action
				- clicking a button can invoke one command, but crossing the bar and input two commands with two crossing directions
				- ![[Pasted image 20250830103259.png]]
			- **Fluid Composition**-
				- enables fluid composition of commands to develop a more continous style of interaction
				- users can select multiple commands with a single stroke crossing the menu items
				- uiseful for apps such as drawing applications
		- **Steering**-
			- navigate, or steer through a 2D tunnel without touching the boundaries of the tunnel
			- a tunnel is any UI Control that requires thje user to move the cursor or drag finger on tyouchscreen along a pathy that has borders
			- overtstepping the border has conseuquences
			- Examples-
				- drop down menus
				- parameter control sliders
				- scroll bars
				- videio playuback scrubber bars
				- video game elements
			- accessing hierarchial menyus
				- have to navigate down one menu and select an item then a new menu appears
				- have to navigfate down that menu as well without going out of the tunnel (or both menus could close and have to start again)
		- **Gesturing**-
			- made of non-verbal interaction medium and can provide intuitive and natural way to interact with computers
			- gesturing is a free-form uinput method
			- usually without constraints of a user interface elemtns like buttons and slide bars
