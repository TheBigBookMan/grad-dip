## Experiment Design
- 3 important steps of HCI are design, implement and evaluate a computing system
- learning to conduct and design an experiemnt is a skill in research
- **Experiment Design**-
	- process of deciding what variables (independent variables, dependent variables, control variables and random variables) to use
	- what tasks and procedures to use
	- how many participants to use 
	- how to solicit them
- **Control Experiement**-
	- make sure to control for outside variables that may influence the results and cause skewed data
- **Methodology**-
	- way an experiment is designed and carrie dout
	- involves deciding on people (participants), the hardware and software (materials or apparatus), the tasks, the order of tasks, the procedure for briefing and preparing the participants, the variables, the data collected and analysed and so on
	- havig sound methodology is critical
	- need to follow standards for experiments with human participants and not just make it up because it seems reasonable
	- American Psychological Society (APA) is predominant organisation promoting research in psych- the improvement of research methods and conditions and the application of research findings
- **Ethics Approval**-
	- crucial step that precedes every HCI experiment
	- experiments involve humans and therefore researchers must respect safety, welfare and dignity of human participants in their research and treat them equally and fairly
	- researchers need to submit documents to review committee to apply for ethics approval
	- typically review committee serves to ensure several ethical guidelines are aknowledged and adhered to
	- important to include the right of the participant to be informaed of
		- the nature of the research (hypotheses, goals, objectives)
		- research methodology (medical procedures, questionaiires, participant observeation)
		- any risks or beenfits
		- right not to participate, not to answer any questions and/or terminate participation at any time without prejudice (without academic penalty, withdrawl or remuneration)
		- right to anonymity and confidentiality
- **Getting Started with Experiment Design**-
	- need to begin with the question: What are the experimental variables?
	- variables are the factors and conditions you can modify and measure in the experiment and properly formed research questions inherently identify experimental variables
	- **Hypotheses**-
		- statement of predicted or expected relationshup between at least two variables
		- provisional answer to a research question
		- to form a good hypotheses we need to define the variables inbolved and define a relationshup between the variables
		- five standards for good hypotheses:
			- **Testable**-
				- manipulating the variables and/pr measuring the outcome variable must potentially exist
			- **Falsifiable**-
				- must be able to disprove the hypothesis with data
			- **Concise**-
				- should be stated in simplest adequate form
			- **Precise**-
				- should be specific (operationalised)
			- **Useful**-
				- should relate to existing theories and/or point towards new theories
				- should lead to studies beyond the present one
				- hard to determine in advance
	- **Independent Variables**-
		- circumstance or characteristic that is manipulated in an experiment to elicit a change in human response while interacting with computer
		- represensts the cause or reason for an outcome
		- 'independent' because they are independent of participant behavour (nothing a participant can do to influence an independent variable
		- example- interface, device, feedback mode, button layout, visual layout, age, gender, background noise, expertise etc
		- synoym of factor
		- must have two levels
			- the two levels, values or settings for an IV are the test conditions
			- name both the factor and level
			- ![[Pasted image 20250811124520.png]]
		- human charactersitics are naturally occurring attributes- age, gender, height, weight, handedness, grip strength, finger width, visual acuity, personality trait, political viewpoint, first language, shoe size etc
		- cannot be manipulated in the same way as an attribute of an interface
		- experiment must have atleast 1 IV but possible to have more
		- higher number of effects increases rapidly with size of experiement
			- ie two IVs = 2 effects and 1 interaction effect
	- **Dependent Variables**-
		- IV are the variables that the experimenter changes to test their dependent vairables
		- a change in the IV directly causes a change in the DV
		- the effect on the DV is measured and recorded
		- a DV is a measured human behaviour- related to an aspect of the interaction involving an IV
		- they are 'dependent' because they depend on what the participant foes
		- example- task completion time, speed, accuracy, error rate, throughput, target re-entries, task retries, presses of backspace etc
		- dependent variables must be clearly defined aso that the other researchers can reproduce your study
		- any observable, measurable behaviour is a legit DV (provided it has the potential to reveal differences among the test conditions)
		- novel DV- 'negative facial expressions' 
	- **Control Variables**-
		- many circumstances or factors that (might influence a dependent variable but are not under investigation)
		- these need to be accommodated in some manner
		- best to control them
		- examples- room lighting, room temperature, background noise, display size, mouse shape, mouse cursor speed, keyboard angle, chair height etc
		- not always things you would think about, but they exist and may influence a DV
		- controlling them means they are fixed at a nominal setting during the experiment so they do not interfere
		- they might interfere if they are set at an extreme value
		- allowing such circumstances to exist at a fixed nominal value is typical in experiment research
		- the circumstances are treated as control variables
		- a control variable is a circumstance (not under investigation) that is kept constant while testing the effect of an IV
		- it is not a variable of interest in the study but it is controlled because it could influence the outcomes
		- more control means the experiment is less generaliseable (less applicale to other people and other situations)
	- **Random Variables**-
		- instead of controlling all circumstances or factors, some allowed to vary randomly
		- values of random variables as representing random sample of all values or instances of that variable
		- there is a cost since more variability is introduced in measures
		- is a benefit since results are more generalisable
		- tpically random variables pertain to characterstics of the participants including biometrics (height, weight etc), social disposition (relaxed, nervous etc) or even genetics (gender, IQ)- these charactersitcsi are allowed to vary at random
	- **Confounding Variables**-
		- any circumstnace or condition that changes systematically with an IV is a confounding variable
		- unlike control or random variables, confounding are usually problematic in experimental research
		- is the effect observed due to the IV or to confounding variable
		- researchers must attune to the possible presense of a confounding variable and elimnate it, adjust for it or consider in someway
		- otherwise effects observed may be incorrectly interpreted
		- example- setups can use different technology when trying to measure the one thing, and the result isnt a reflection of the persons behaviour, its a result because of the different technology (irrelevant)
